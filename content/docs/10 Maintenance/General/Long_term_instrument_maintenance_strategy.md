6 elements of a Long-Term Instrument Maintenance Strategy  

1) Validate Data Accuracy  
it's important for someone to periodically verify that your instrument is performing within specification, this ensures that scientific conclusions are based on accurate and reproducible data sets.   

2) Keep up with the maintenance schedule  
To prevent delays from instrument downtime, someone will need to perform maintenance activities which involves coordinating the replacement of internal components based on the age of each system.  

3) Manage software updates  
New software versions offer additional features and increased stability and compatibility. Someone needs to ensure that all computers are updated to the newest release to maximize productivity.  

4) Coordinate repairs  
There should be a defined end to end process which includes all internal and external steps;  such as trouble shooting, request for quote, service budget allocation, management approvals, purchase order creation, and scheduling. Reducing the number of steps and automating the end to end process minimizes the impact of instrument downtime.  

5) Document maintenance  
To bring traceability to data or decisions that may be called into question it is critical that the documentation which validates instrument performance is both easily available and complete.   

6) Longevity and robustness  
Ensure that the people involved have the skillset and resources to execute their tasks quickly â€“ and have a back-up plan in the event of personnel changes.
