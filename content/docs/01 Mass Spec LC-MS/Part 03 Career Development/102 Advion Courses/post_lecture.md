## Self Introduction  

Okay, welcome to Advion. We're a world leader in mass spec and analytical chemistry workflow solutions. I'm David Patterson, the President and CEO of Advion. You are here this week, because you have purchased one or more of our solutions, we thank you very, very much for that. And we also are very attuned to the fact that you wish to use that solution to its best advantage. We are here, because we want to make sure that the system becomes as approachable and usable as we are as your your partner. It's intrinsically very rewarding for us that after about six years of being in the market with the compact mass spec, we are now rapidly approaching about 1000 units having been sold to academic institutions pharma and biotech, speciality, chemical, and other companies, you are now part of that family. And and we feel that very much, we are here to absolutely support you. So this course is going to be taught by some of our best and brightest scientists and chemists, and even one of our founders are scientific founder. And we intend to have you experience everything from very fundamental to very applied concepts, you're you'll see a lot of sample introduction systems, different integrations, different modalities, and we want you to go back and be able to use the system very, very confidently. So we care about your success more than, than anything, because probably 90% of our sales comes from word of mouth, and testimonial and references. So that's a very key thing for us is is what you experience and how you experience us. So with that, I will turn this over to Dr. Jack Henion. He's our scientific founder, and presently our chief scientific officer, and I hope you have a great next few days.
I want to echo that. That point that we really value your being here. And we really want to support your use of the instrument because without you being familiar with it and having a metal mesh with applications that you have, the last thing you want is for sitting on the bench not being used. And so the more you learn and know about it, and how to use it for applications, the more successful you'll be and the more successful we will be. I am an emeritus professor at Cornell University. I've started as a service laboratory doing mass spectrometry. I did my first LCMS experiment before some of you were born in the fall spring of 1974. It was a crude experiment, but it was the first one I did. And I've been fortunate to be through the entire history of modern LCMS development, the commercial development and so forth. So a fair amount of experience applications in at Cornell were initially of all things racehorse drug testing, so confirming drugs in the urine and blood of a racehorse that evolved into a research program supporting the pharmaceutical industry doing analysis of biological samples by LC MS and LC ms ms. And you name it, I have interfaced it to a mass spectrometry that includes SFC scientific means supercritical fluid chromatography, and that works very nicely on our Abyan system also, I am chromatography, capillary electrophoresis. All these things have been published in the past from our laboratory, my laboratory and others, so a fair amount of experience and doing that.  

## Mass spectrometry History

This goes back to 1984, when John Fenn, who shared the Nobel Prize several years ago, reported this. develop this. It actually goes back to 1967, a researcher at in Chicago, who did the very first electrospray, but did not appreciate how powerful it could be. It was John Fenn, who applied it to macromolecules and small molecules. And that was the beginning of a revolution. I was of interest in the mid 80s. That was 1984. In the mid 80s, I followed his work at my research group, and we were quickly sold on this, I like the idea, you couldn't buy it, you had to make it yourself, no big deal. And we did. And I reported it at a ASMS meeting in 1985. I went to that was in June, and in October, I went to another meeting in Germany and an agent at the time of that ASMS meeting, there were four people on the planet, we were one of them doing electrospray.by November, there were 20 people doing it, it just took off nothing took off any faster than the interest in electrospray because John Fenn showed that it could do proteins and in even inorganic polymers.  

Ions spray was a patent at Cornell in my laboratory in 1986. [lecture 02]
