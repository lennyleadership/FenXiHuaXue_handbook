Increase of the LC-MS/MS sensitivity and detection limits using on-line sample preparation with large volume plasma injection

PMID: 15936252 DOI: 10.1016/j.jchromb.2005.03.047

Abstract  
Large volume injection (LVI) has systematically been studied to improve LC-MS/MS sensitivity (signal-to-noise ratio, or S/N) and detection limits. The method of LVI was combined with on-line solid phase extraction (on-line SPE) and LC-MS/MS detection for analysis of compounds directly in plasma. It was demonstrated that LVI of plasma with on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS allows for improvement of sensitivity and detection limits without compromising chromatographic peak shape and resolution and inducing significant matrix and signal suppression effects. Furthermore, sensitivity and detection limits improve linearly with the injection volume up to 100 microL. Quantification of the model compounds in plasma demonstrated comparable calibration curve statistics, precision and accuracy for 5, 50 and 100 microL plasma injections.
