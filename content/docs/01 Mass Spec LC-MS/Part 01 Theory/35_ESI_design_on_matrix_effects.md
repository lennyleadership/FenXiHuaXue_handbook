<b><font class = "font_upper">Summary</font></b>:  
The Turbo Ion Spray (off-axis geometry), Turbo VTM Source (orthogonal geometry) and the Standard Z-Spray Source (double orthogonal geometry) did not differ much in their susceptibility to MEs.   

<mark class="lemon">The Jet Stream ESI (orthogonal geometry) reaches a higher sensitivity by an additional heated sheath gas, but suffers at the same time from significantly stronger signal suppressions than the comparable Standard ESI (orthogonal geometry) without sheath gas</mark>. No relation between source geometry and extent of signal suppression was found in this study.

This study investigates to which extent the design of electrospray ion sources influences the susceptibility to matrix effects (MEs) in liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). For this purpose, MEs were measured under comparable conditions (identical sample extracts, identical LC column, same chromatographic method and always <u>positive ion mode</u>) on four LC–MS/MS instrument platforms. The instruments were combined with five electrospray ion sources, viz. <u>Turbo Ion Spray</u>, <u>Turbo VTM Source</u>, <u>Standard ESI</u>, <u>Jet Stream ESI</u> and <u>Standard Z-Spray Source</u>. The comparison of MEs could be made at all retention times because the method of permanent postcolumn infusion was applied. The MEs ascertained for 45 pesticides showed for each electrospray ion source the same pattern, i.e. the same number of characteristic signal suppressions at equivalent retention times in the chromatogram.
