The use of `thermospray` (TSP) for small molecule LC-MS applications also facilitated familiarity with the concept of generation of ions through cation attachment (e.g.,[M + NH4]<sup>+</sup>) and the use of negative ion mode for acidic compounds. TSP found tremendous use as an interface for higher flow-rate LC/MS, including for pesticide residue analysis.  

`ES ionization` and `APCI` (atmospheric pressure) are now among the most commonly used techniques for creating ions from pesticides in solution.  

The application of the more recent atmospheric pressure photoionization (`APPI`) to pesticide residue analysis is less common.  

Although still at the development stage, there has been growing interest in `EI` for LC-MS to obtain library-matchable, readily interpretable, mass spectra, to aid the confirmation of identity of targeted pesticides and, more importantly, for the characterization of unknowns such as metabolites or transformation products.
