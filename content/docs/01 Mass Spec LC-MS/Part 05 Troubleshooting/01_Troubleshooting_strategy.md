sensitivity change

make new mobile phase A with pH modifier(aqeuous solution)  rational: the pH promote the charged state of the analyte over its neutral species.
mobile phase was contaminated attributing to rising baselines, noise or spikes.

chromatography: 




Troubleshooting strategy:
1) isolate area. [sample preparation, mass spectrometer, HPLC, monitoring]  
2) rule out simple problem.  
3) 

Questions to be answered:  
1) Did electrospray ionization work properly?
2) Did mass spectrometer work properly? [autotune reports, such as declustering potential, collision energy, collision exit cell potential, pressure]
3) Did LC work properly? [mobile phase ageing



Steps:  
1) check mass spectrometer performance. (autotune reports, parameters, asymmetric spray (blockage))
2) 



Useful diagnostic tools: 
1) a known standard  
2) unschedule method  
3) monitoring plots of internal standards, blank, instrument parameters  
4) infusion the tuning solution to check mass spectrometer  
5) check autotuning reports.  
6)
