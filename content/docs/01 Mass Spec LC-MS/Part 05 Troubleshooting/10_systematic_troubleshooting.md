### Carry-over
Carry-over is probably one of the most commonly encountered problems of LC/MS/MS method development. Sources of problems range from instrument hardware and the selection of appropriate rinse solvents to challenges with chromatography. Frequently, resolving the problem requires a combination of individual experimental solutions and systematic and logical investigation.   

<u>**The gradient elution** was actually determined to be the cause of the carry-over effect</u>. To address the issue, <u>an isocratic elution with a mobile phase that contained 45% acetonitrile was used to eliminate the carryover</u>. A new problem surfaced when the original internal standard was not retained on the column in the mobile phase, so a new one had to be used. The new standard had retention properties similar to those of the analyte. Figure 2 depicts the resolution of the carry-over problem. The method was validated and successfully used for sample analysis.  chromatographic condition and internal standard were changed as a result of the problem and its solution. Occasionally, carry-over problems have simpler solutions. In another example, simply raising the needle height solved the carry-over effect. Carry-over is often avoided by merely minimizing the contact surface between analyte and needle
The ritonavir example is one of the more
