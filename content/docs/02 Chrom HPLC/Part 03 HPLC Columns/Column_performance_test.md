## Shodex Column Test Conditions (Reversed Phase, Hydrophilic Interaction and Normal Phase Chromatography Columns)
To check the deterioration of column performance, measure the column plate number and compare it with the number written in the inspection data sheet which is attached to the column. The test conditions for calculation of the plate number is determined for each column type and shown in the table below.  

When you first use a column, we recommend you to measure its plate number before use. Plate number (N) can be calculated by the formula in the following figure.

## Sigma-Aldrich Guide

Performance evaluation mixes for HPLC columns.

Well defined test mixes enable you to troubleshoot chromatographic problems, optimize system efficiency, and evaluate columns under conditions where their performance is understood. We ship our test mixes in amber ampuls to prevent photodegradation, and we include instructions for proper use and interpretation of results.

Choose from column-specific or application-specific mixes. Refer to our catalog for our extensive selection of test mixes, or call our Technical Service Department.
