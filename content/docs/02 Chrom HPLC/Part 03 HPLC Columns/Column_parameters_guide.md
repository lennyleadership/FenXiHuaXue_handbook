# Column Parameters (Bonded Phase Type, L, $d_p$, $d_c$) 


While the  C<sub>18</sub> stationary phase is traditionally used, the selectivity of different bonded phases is often exploited for the separation of closely eluting pairs of key analytes in critical analyses. Column screening with a variety of stationary phases that offers different retention mechanisms can occur during either initial method development or the fine-tuning steps but may be dependent on the availability of suitable samples. Automated column/mobile phase screening systems equipped with multiport selection valves (Figure 10.5) are typically used with an “orthogonal” column set (e.g.  C<sub>18</sub> ( C<sub>8</sub>),  C<sub>18</sub> AQ, phenyl, cyano, polar-embedded, and pentafluorophenyl).

Column dimensions (L, $\textrm{d}_p$, $\textrm{d}_c$) are matched to the intended application and can be optimized to enhance efficiency, speed, or sensitivity. One useful strategy is to use short UHPLC columns (50 × 3.0 mm, sub-3-μm) for rapid column/mobile phase screening, followed by optimization with longer columns (to maximize resolution) using the selected bonded phase [5]. SPPs are preferred in RPC because of the higher efficiency as compared to similar totally porous particles (TPPs) [10].
