Here is some basic principle for HPLC column choice.

* Matrices / Substrate
* Stationary phase / Ligand
* Particle diameter
* Pore size
* column size
* Guard columns

## Matrices / Substrate
Silica gel

Silica gel is an ideal chromatography packing material for bonded-phase HPLC columns. Silica gel is a rigid particle that can withstand the compression of liquid streams. It is widely used in analysis and preparative HPLC.

PSDVB resin

PSDVB (polystyrene divinylbenzene) packing is ideal for small-scale chromatographic analysis. It is chemically stable, rigid, and does not show soluble substances or precipitate. PSDVB particles can be used as reversed-phase chromatography packing material that doesn't need a bonding phase. After coating and derivatization, it can be made into cation and anion exchange resins.

Core-shell resin

Core-shell resin is widely used in UPLC columns. It is relatively new material. Compared with silica gel, its particle diameter can be less than 3&mu;m.

## Stationary phase / Ligand
The traditional ligands are C18(octadecyl silane, ODS), C8, C4, $\small{\textrm{NH}}_2$, CN, phenyl, diol, PFP, AQ. Other ligands are double-phenyl, biphenylyl, naphthyl.

The bonded phase can provide a significantly different selectivity than the stationary phase to achieve successful separation, or increased selectivity for certain mobile phases, or other bonded phases.

For the ion-exchange column, the ligands are classified into strong cation, weak cation, strong anion, and weak anion. The selection is based on the sample properties.

## Particle diameter

The common particle diameter for analysis HPLC columns is 3&mu;m, 3.5&mu;m, 5&mu;m, 8&mu;m, 10&mu;m. For preparative columns, there are particles of  10&mu;m, 20&mu;m, 30&mu;m, 40&mu;m, 50&mu;m, 75&mu;m.

Particles are less than 3&mu;m, like 2.7&mu;m, 1.8&mu;m, 1.2&mu;m, which are used in UPLC analysis.

The back pressure of the column is higher with smaller packing materials. There is a pressure limit in the HPLC system, making sure that the column pressure didn't over your system limit.

## Pore size
The most popular pore size of HPLC columns is 100$\mathring{A}$, 120$\mathring{A}$, 300$\mathring{A}$. Some suppliers also provide particles with 80$\mathring{A}$, 200$\mathring{A}$, 500$\mathring{A}$.

For PSDVB particles, there are particles with a pore size of 1000$\mathring{A}$, 2000$\mathring{A}$, 5000$\mathring{A}$.

The choice of pore size is according to the size of your samples.

## Column size
The inner-diameter of HPLC columns is 2.0/2.1mm, 3.0mm, 4.0mm, 4.6mm, 7.8mm, 10mm, 20mm, 21.2mm, 30mm, and 50mm. It is international convention in HPLC development.

The length of columns is customized from 25mm to 500mm. Some customers even use a column length of 1000mm.

For small particles like 3&mu;m packing materials, we highly recommend using thin and short columns.

If the particle diameter of the packing material is halved, the n&mu;mber of plates will be doubled (the column length remains the same), and the column pressure is increased by a factor of 4. If the column length is doubled, the n&mu;mber of plates and analysis time will be double. The longer the column length, the more the pressure increases linearly.

## Guard columns
Whether or not to use a guard column depends on the sample and experimental conditions. The column size of our guard column is 4.6mm*10mm. We also provide tiny guard columns from the USA with nearly zero dead volume.
