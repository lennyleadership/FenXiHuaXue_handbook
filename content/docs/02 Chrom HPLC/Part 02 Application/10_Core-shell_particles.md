<figcaption><b>Figure 2</b>: The schematic representation of forming core–shell silica particles by the LbL approach. The preparation starts with a surface charged solid microsphere. The chargedpolymer and oppositely charged nanospheres are in turn deposited onto the microsphere surface to produce the core shell particles. Different deposition cycles may beapplied to form the shell with different thickness.</figcaption>
