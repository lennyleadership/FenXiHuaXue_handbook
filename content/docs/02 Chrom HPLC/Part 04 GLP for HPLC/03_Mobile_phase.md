## Thermo Guide  

Do not use highly acidic or basic solvents unless your HPLC system and column have been engineered to accommodate them. Seals, plungers etc. can be damaged by extreme pH conditions.  

The HPLC column has been engineered to accommodate highly aqueous solvents – traditional alkyl chain media can be prone to phase collapse in low organic composition solvent mixes, for example at less than 5% organic solvent.  

Highly aqueous mobile phases are ideal breeding grounds for microbes. Ensure that an organic solvent is flushed through the HPLC system and column at least once every 48 hours to kill unwanted microbial growth. Alternatively add a small amount of sodium azide to the aqueous solvent to inhibit growth.

<b>Note</b>: Never allow a HPLC column or system to stand with water or buffer in it for an extended period of time (for example, over a holiday break). Always flush with a solvent mix that contains a minimum of 20% organic in water.

<mark class = "lemon">Low sensitivity and rising baselines, noise, or spikes on the chromatogram can often be attributed to the mobile phase</mark>. Contaminants in the mobile phase are especially troublesome in gradient elution. The baseline may rise, and spurious peaks can appear as the level of the contaminated component increases.

Water is the most common source of contamination in reversed phase analyses. You should use only high purity distilled or deionized water when formulating mobile phases. However, several common deionizers introduce organic contaminants into the water. To remove these contaminants, pass the deionized water through activated charcoal or a preparative C18 column.

Use only HPLC grade solvents, salts, ion pair reagents, and base and acid modifiers. Cleaning lower quality solvents is time consuming, and trace levels of contaminants often remain. These trace contaminants can cause problems when you use a high sensitivity ultraviolet or fluorescence detector.

Because many aqueous buffers promote the growth of bacteria or algae, you should prepare these solutions fresh, and filter them (0.2 μm or 0.45 μm filter) before use. Filtering also will remove particles that could produce a noisy baseline, or plug the column. Prevent microorganism growth by adding about 100 ppm of sodium azide to aqueous buffers. Alternatively, these buffers may also be mixed with 20% or more of an organic solvent such as ethanol or acetonitrile.

To prevent bubbles in the system, <font color ="blue">degas the mobile phase</font>. Generally, an in-line degasser is a first choice, but sparging with helium can be an alternative if the mobile phase does not contain any volatile components.

Use ion pair reagents carefully. The optimum chain length and concentration of the reagent must be determined for each analysis. Concentrations can be as low as 0.2 mM, or as high as 150 mM, or more. In general, increasing the concentration or chain length increases retention times. High concentrations (>50%) of acetonitrile or some other organic solvents can precipitate ion pair reagents. Also, some salts of ion pair reagents are insoluble in water and will precipitate. Avoid this by using sodium-containing buffers in the presence of long chain sulfonic acids (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate), instead of potassium-containing buffers.

Volatile basic and acidic modifiers, such as triethylamine (TEA) and trifluoracetic acid (TFA), are useful when you wish to recover a compound for further analysis. These modifiers also let you avoid problems associated with ion pair reagents. They can be added to the buffer at concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0% TEA or 0.01 to 0.15% TFA. Increasing the concentration may improve peak shape for certain compounds, but can alter retention times.

Recycling the mobile phase used for isocratic separations has become more popular as a means of reducing the cost of solvents, their disposal, and mobile phase preparation time. A solvent recovery apparatus uses a microprocessor controlled switching valve to direct the solvent stream to waste when a peak is detected. When the baseline falls under the selected threshold, uncontaminated solvent is directed back to the solvent reservoir.
