## Buffer

All buffers should be prepared freshly on the day required.  Two reasons:  
1) pH is affected by prolonged storage.  
2) there is microbial growth present.  

Buffer shelf life reference: pharmacopoeia monographs or similar.  

Buffer reagents can contain a stabilizing agent, for example, <font color = "blue">sodium metabisulphite</font>. These stabilizing agents often affect the optical and chromatographic behaviour of buffer solutions, so it is often <font color = "blue">worth buying reagents that contain no stabilizer</font>. Containers of solid reagent are easily contaminated by repeated use. For this reason, we recommend that regents be purchased in low container weights.
