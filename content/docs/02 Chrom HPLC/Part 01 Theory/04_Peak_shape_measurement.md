Chromatogram Peak.

## How is peak shape measured?

The tailing factor is determined by drawing a perpendicular line from the peak centre to the baseline of the peak. Then the peak width and the front half-width are measured for the peak at 5% of the height of the peak. The tailing factor is simply the entire peak width divided by twice the front half-width.  
  
The non-pharmaceutical world tends to use the asymmetry factor instead of the tailing factor to measure peak tailing. The asymmetry factor is based on the front and back half-widths of the peak, but these are measured at 10% of the peak height. The asymmetry factor is determined by dividing the back half-width by the front half-width.
