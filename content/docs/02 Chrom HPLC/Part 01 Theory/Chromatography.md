Separation is based on differences in hydrophobicity by partitioning between an apolar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. Together with appropriate control of operational parameters such as solvent composition, pH, temperature, and flow rate, reversed phase can enable separations of many analytes with a wide range of polarities and molecular weight. Columns with C8 and C18 stationary phases on high purity silica are the most widely used.
