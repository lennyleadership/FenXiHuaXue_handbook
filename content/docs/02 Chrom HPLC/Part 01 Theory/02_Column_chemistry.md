Pore size recommendations:  
Use 60 - 80Å pore size column packings to separate small molecules equal to or less than 4000MW to maximize loading capacity and retention.  

Use 95 or 300Å pore size columns for larger molecules like polypeptides ad proteins (from 4000 to 500,000 MW) to maintain high efficiency.

#### Carbon Load

Carbon Load refers to the % carbon content of the silica bonded stationary phase.  

Generally speaking, <font color = "blue">a high carbon load (example 18-25%) results in a more hydrophobic surface. The surface is also more resistant to high pH</font>.  

A high carbon load does not necessarily provide the best resolution.

### The bonded-phase

#### Greater than 20% Organic  

**C18** offers the most retention, maybe too much for some samples.

**C8** Less retentive than C18, but with similar selectivity in most cases. Often provides a little more retention than C18 with similar
selectivity.   

**Phenyl** significantly less retentive for non-polar compounds but retains polar compounds, so reduces analysis time for mixture if polar/non polar. 
**CN** least retentive, changes in selectivity, good for reducing analysis time with late eluters and avoiding gradient separations

#### High Aqueous Mobile Phases (Below 20% Organic)

**C18** rarely offers retention advantages, and selectivity may not be optimum with little retention

**C8** often provides a little more retention than C18 with similar selectivity  

**Phenyl** most retentive with changes in selectivity

**C3** similar to Phenyl in retention but some changes in selectivity from C18, C8 and Phenyl   

**CN** least retentive, definite changes in selectivity, good resolution

## Galak Column Chemistry

### C18 Reversed-phase Column

Hydrophobicity is the primary mechanism of analyte interaction with C18 and other alkyl-bonded stationary phases. In addition, the polarity of the phase will also contribute to the overall selectivity observed.

**Hydrophobicity** 

The strength of hydrophobic interaction can be measured by the retention of neutral (non-polar) molecules. The k values (retention factors) for a neutral species, for a given C18 phase, will give an indication of the surface area and surface coverage (ligand density) of the silica.

The percentage of carbon in the material is a simplistic but useful guide to the hydrophobic retention characteristics of a column. In Figure 1 this loose correlation is demonstrated by the increase in retention observed when alkyl chain length (i.e. carbon load) is increased. This increase results from an increase in hydrophobicity of the stationary phase. Similarly, an increase in retention would be expected in going from a C18 phase with a low carbon load to one of high carbon load.

Hydrophobic selectivity can be determined from the retention factor ratio between two neutral species. This is a better measure of surface coverage than carbon content, as surface area and porosity may vary from silica to silica.

**Polarity**  

The second key property of C18 materials is their silanol activity, often discussed in terms of polarity. This can be determined by measuring the retention factor ratio between a basic and an acidic compound. At pH >7 the total ion-exchange capacity will correspond to a measure of the total silanol activity. At acidic pH (e.g. pH 2.7) an indication of the acidic activity of the silanol groups can be obtained. The presence of metal ions in the base silica increases the level of silanol activity. Older generation silicas have higher and less tightly controlled levels of metal ions, and hence higher silanol activity compared to newer generation alkyl bonded phases. For this and other reasons, it is strongly recommended that new method development should be approached using newer generation higher purity silicas.

**High Purity Base Deactivated Phases** 

Modern alkyl bonded phases have very low cumulative metal ion levels within the base silica (<10ppm), resulting in the number of isolated silanol groups, and hence the polarity of the silica surface, also being reduced. Combined with more effective and reproducible bonding processes, these newer generation reversed-phase materials lead to significantly improved chromatography for the more basic polar solute molecules. The use of bonded alkyl groups containing hydrophilic substituents (i.e. polar embedded) can either enhance this effect and/or offer alternative selectivity.  

**Optimizing Selectivity**  

Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the change in polarity and hydrophobicity for typical C18, C8, and C4 materials, showing a decrease in hydrophobicity on reducing alkyl chain length. Greater ligand density, and hence lower polarity, is also seen as the length of the alkyl chain is reduced. However, changing the alkyl chain length may reduce analysis time but will not significantly affect selectivity. Changing the chemistry to an alternative bonded phase is a more powerful tool to achieve this.  

**Older Generation ‘Traditional’ Phases**  

The older ‘traditional’ C18 phases are hydrophobic and have a high polarity due to the lower purity silica containing a higher level of acidic silanol groups on which they are based. The use of the newer high purity silicas reduces the resultant phases’ silanol activity and improves reproducibility. Employing a polar embedded functionality may also result in a reduced polarity material. For basic solutes that will interact strongly with surface silanols, lower polarity phases are generally recommended. However, for certain analyses, the additional interactions provided by the surface silanols of a ‘traditional’ C18 material may be beneficial to the overall separation.  


### Phenyl Reversed-phase Column  

Phenyl bonded silica phases offer an alternative reversed-phase selectivity to alkyl bonded phases. They show lower hydrophobic retention than their C18 counterparts, with similar retention characteristics to C8-bonded phases. Phenyl stationary phases interact with compounds containing aromatic groups or unsaturated bonds through the involvement of π-π interactions. For aromatic solutes containing an electronegative atom or group (e.g. F, NO2), the degree of π-π interactions with the phenyl phase will increase.    

Due to the rigid nature of the phenyl ring, the solute shape can also influence selectivity.  

Traditional phenyl phases tend to be less stable than the corresponding C8 or C18 reversed-phases. Additionally, the larger steric size of the phenyl group reduces surface coverage, leaving a greater number of exposed silanol sites. More recently introduced phenyl phases show greater stability. The use of a purer silica base, more effective and reproducible bonding procedures and the availability of a sterically protected phenyl silane all contribute to greater phase robustness and reduced column bleed.  

Conventional phenyl phases are bonded to the silica through a propyl spacer. The incorporation of the longer chain hexyl spacer results in increased hydrophobic retention and aromatic selectivity.  

### Polar Bonded Silica Phases

Polar bonded silica phases offer an alternative selectivity to alkyl bonded materials. In general, they have a lower hydrophobicity but higher polarity. Cyano, amino and diol bonded phases can be used in both normal- and reversed-phase modes. In normal-phase, they equilibrate more rapidly with the eluent than silica itself and are not deactivated by traces of water.  

Cyano bonded phases show unique selectivity for polar compounds and are more suitable than bare silica for normal-phase gradient separations. The cyano functional group is a strong dipole that can interact with other dipoles or induce dipoles on solutes. These phases also exhibit moderate hydrophobicity due to the alkyl linker.  

Amino bonded phases show alternative normal-phase selectivity to unbonded silica, especially for aromatics. Amino columns are also used in the HILIC mode for carbohydrate analysis and for other polar compounds. Their weak anion-exchange properties can be used in the analysis of anions and organic acids.  

Diol bonded phases are a versatile alternative to unbonded silica for normal-phase separations. The hydroxyl groups provide good selectivity without excessive retention since H-bonding with the diol layer is weaker than with silanols. Some diol bonded phases have been developed specifically for HILIC applications. Differing pore size materials are used in size-exclusion separations.
