Particulates are frequently the main source of the elevated back pressure that can greatly impact the column efficiency, and the main sources are from the sample, mobile phase, and LC Instrument wear and tear. For many labs out there, who are running a lot of complex samples with dirty matrices, consider <font color ="blue">centrifuging and filtering</font> your sample using syringe filters or filter vials prior to analysis. Also, <font color ="blue">avoiding sample diluent mismatch</font> can tremendously help mitigate sample crash or precipitation. Sometimes <font color ="blue">adjusting the needle insertion depth</font> to make sure the injector is drawing from the supernatant of the sample can also help prevent particulates from entering the column.  

Column clogging from mobile phase can occur due to <font color ="blue">bacterial growth</font> in poorly maintained aqueous mobile phase bottles and precipitation of buffer salts. In all cases, mobile phases should be freshly prepared with HPLC-grade solvents and capped. At times, <font color ="blue">normal wear of the injection valve rotor seal and pump seals</font> also generates particulates that can clog the column packing bed. You can avoid this by simply replacing the parts as a part of your routine preventative maintenance schedule.

Finally, <font color ="blue">using a guard column or an UltraShield pre-column filter</font>, can significantly reduce the risk of clogging your analytical column. When using a guard column, make sure you always select the phase system that is designed for your analytical columns. Clean samples, freshly prepared mobile phase, and routinely maintaining your instrument should help prevent clogging and increase your column lifetime.
