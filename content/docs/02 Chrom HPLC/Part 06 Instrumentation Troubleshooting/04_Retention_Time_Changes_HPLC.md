### Retention Time Changes from Injection to Injection  

The most common cause of peak retention time drift is an un-equilibrated system. The detector and fluid system must be stable prior to starting an analysis.  

Temperature changes during the analysis are another major cause of peak drift. If your analytical column is subject to fluctuations in temperature, then we recommend that the column is housed in a thermally controlled environment, such as a column oven/jacket etc.   

Finally, where possible, we recommend the pre-mixing of all solvents used in isocratic methods.

### Continually Increasing or Decreasing Retention Times

The most common cause of peak retention time drift in one direction is poorly prepared or mixed solvents or a system leak.   

If you are confident that the solvents were prepared correctly, then it is very important that you determine whether they are being mixed correctly (mixing cell problems). Where solvents are mixed manually prior to pumping, ensure that the solvent flow rate is correct and constant.

### Increasing/Decreasing to a New Constant Retention Time

The most common cause of new constant value direction is poorly prepared or mixed solvents.  

If you are confident hat the solvents were prepared correctly, then it is very important that you determine whether they are being mixed correctly (mixing cell problems).  

Where solvents are mixed manually prior to pumping, ensure that the solvent flow rate is correct and constant.  

The last most common cause of retention time change is a leak in the system or build up of contaminants.

        1. Leak.<br />
        <br />
        2. Change in mobile phase composition. (Small changes can lead to large changes in retention times.)<br />
        <br />
        3. Air trapped in pump. (Retention times increase and decrease at random times.)<br />
        <br />
        4. Column temperature fluctuations (especially evident in ion exchange systems).<br />
        <br />
        5. Column overloading. (Retention times usually decrease as mass of solute injected on column exceeds column capacity.)<br />
        <br />
        6. Sample solvent incompatible with mobile phase.<br />
        <br />
        7. Column problem. (Not a common cause of erratic retention. As a column ages, retention times gradually decrease.)

        1. Check system for loose fittings. Check pump for leaks, salt buildup, unusual noises. Change pump seals if necessary.<br />
        <br />
        2. Check make-up of mobile phase. If mobile phase is machine mixed using proportioning values, hand mix and supply from one reservoir.<br />
        <br />
        3. Purge air from pump head or check valves. Change pump seals if necessary. Be sure mobile phase is degassed.<br />
        <br />
        4. Use reliable column oven. (Note: higher column temperatures increase column efficiency. For optimum results, heat eluant before introducing it onto column.)<br />
        <br />
        5. Inject smaller volume (e.g., 10 μL vs. 100 μL) or inject the same volume after 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions of sample.<br />
        <br />
        6. Adjust solvent. Whenever possible, inject samples in mobile phase.<br />
        <br />
        7. Substitute new column of same type to confirm column as cause. Discard old column if restoration procedures fail.
