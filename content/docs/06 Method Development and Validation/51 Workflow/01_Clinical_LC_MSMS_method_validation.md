## Method Validation Workflow

1. pre-validation testing  
It could also be called method development

2. Validation  
determine accuracy, imprecision, sensitivity, linearity, interferences (specificity), matrix effects, and carryover

## Order of Experiments
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;linearity, within-run imprecision, blank matrix, LLOQ</li>
<li>&nbsp;matrix effect, recovery, interferences</li>
<li>&nbsp;accuracy: certified reference materials, human samples, proficiency testing samples</li>
<li>&nbsp;stability studies</li>
<li>&nbsp;every run should include between-run imprecision samples</li>
<li>&nbsp;carryover, dilutions</li>
</ol>

## Accuracy
evaluation of agreement between LC-MS/MS test results and true value.  

<b>Guidelines</b>: FDA guidelines, CLSI EP9, CLSI EP15, CLSI C62  

## Imprecision
evaluation of agreement between repeated analysis of same sample.  
within-run imprecision  
between-run imprecision  

## Sensitivity
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;depicted by lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of a method
</li>
<li>&nbsp;lowest concentration that can be reproducibly measured
</li>
<li>&nbsp;determined by the imprecision: < 20% between-run imprecision at LLOQ (at minimum use 20 matrix-based replicates over 20 days)
</li>
<li>&nbsp;determined by signal-to-noise ratio: >20:1 at LLOQ is recommended; 10:1 minimum
</li>
<li>&nbsp;ion ratios still have to pass
</li>
</ol>
