## Method Validation Workflow

1. pre-validation testing  
It could also be called method development

2. Validation  
determine accuracy, imprecision, sensitivity, linearity, interferences (specificity), matrix effects, and carryover

## Order of Experiments
<ul>
<li>linearity, within-run imprecision, blank matrix, LLOQ</li>
<li>matrix effect, recovery, interferences</li>
<li>accuracy: dertified reference materials, human samples, proficiency testing samples</li>
<li>stability studies</li>
<li>every run should include between-run imprecision samples</li>
<li>carryover, dilutions</li>
</ul>
