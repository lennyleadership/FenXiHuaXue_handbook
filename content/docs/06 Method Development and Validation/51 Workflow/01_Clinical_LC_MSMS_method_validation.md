## Method Validation Workflow

1. pre-validation testing  
It could also be called method development

2. Validation  
determine accuracy, imprecision, sensitivity, linearity, interferences (specificity), matrix effects, and carryover

## Order of Experiments
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;linearity, within-run imprecision, blank matrix, LLOQ</li>
<li>&nbsp;matrix effect, recovery, interferences</li>
<li>&nbsp;accuracy: dertified reference materials, human samples, proficiency testing samples</li>
<li>&nbsp;stability studies</li>
<li>&nbsp;every run should include between-run imprecision samples</li>
<li>&nbsp;carryover, dilutions</li>
</ol>
