Challenge #1: Sample Preparation  
Sample preparation is always a bottleneck between specificity and the range of chemical properties of the different analytes to be analyzed. <a href="#ref">[1]</a>

Challenge #2: Standards
Some practical problems are related with a huge standard solutions production such as (1) the availability of some pesticides, (2) use of different solvents to dissolve them, and (3) fast degradation of some of them. Recently, to avoid all these disadvantages and to permit the nontarget analysis, the need for screening methods is growing up (Romero-Gonza´lez et al., 2011).  These
methods provide a qualitative binary response, and samples can be classified as
negative and nonnegative, considering nonnegative samples as those containing
one or more analytes above a preestablished concentration level. Then, nonnegative samples must be reanalyzed by an identification/quantification method to determine the final concentration in the positive samples (Romero-Gonza´lez et al., 2011).<a href="#ref">[1]</a>
