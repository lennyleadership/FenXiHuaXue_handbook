## Expectations
A sample preparation procedure for pesticide residue analysis should have the following properties:  
1) include the highest possible number of pesticides (multiresidue assay);   
2) have recoveries as close as possible to 100%;   
3) remove potential interfering compounds in the sample to improve selectivity;  
4) allow increasing concentration of the analytes;   
5) have appropriate precision and ruggedness; and   
6) be quick, easy, safe, and cost-wise. 

## Sample Preparation Methods

1) Dilute-and-shoot   
2) QUECHERS   
3) Matrix solid-phase extraction  
4) Solid-phase extraction
