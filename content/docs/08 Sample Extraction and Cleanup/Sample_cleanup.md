## Lipid Removal:<a href="#ref">[1]</a>
Lipid removal using a sulfuric acid wash or elution of the extract through sulfuric acid-impregnated silica has been described as an effective cleanup for the analysis of OCs, such as hexachlorocyclohexanes, DDT, or chlordanes.   
The dispersion of sulfuric acid onto the surface of activated silica results in a sorbent which can be easily loaded into a column. The use of acidified silica avoids the emulsion problems, reduces the sample handling and solvent consumption, and increases sample throughput.
