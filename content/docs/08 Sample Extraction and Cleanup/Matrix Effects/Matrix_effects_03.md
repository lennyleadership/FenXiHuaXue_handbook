ICH M10 Guideline on matrix effect:  
A matrix effect is defined as an alteration of the analyte response due to interfering and often unidentified component(s) in the sample matrix. During method validation it is necessary to evaluate the matrix effect between different independent sources/lots.  
The matrix effect should be evaluated by analysing at least 3 replicates of low and high QCs, each prepared using matrix from at least 6 different sources/lots. The accuracy should be within ±15% of the nominal concentration and the precision (per cent coefficient of variation (%CV)) should not be greater than 15% in all individual matrix sources/lots. Use of fewer sources/lots may be acceptable in the case of rare matrices.   
The matrix effect should also be evaluated in relevant patient populations or special populations (e.g., hepatically impaired or renally impaired) when available. An additional evaluation of the matrix effect is recommended using haemolysed or lipaemic matrix samples during method validation on a case by case basis, especially when these conditions are expected to occur within the study.  

Q: is it necessary to have calibration standards in matrix factor experiment?  
Our practice is to compare post extracted spiked sample vs aqueous sample, acceptance criteria is CV for matrix factor and IS normalised matrix factor should be ≤ 15%
