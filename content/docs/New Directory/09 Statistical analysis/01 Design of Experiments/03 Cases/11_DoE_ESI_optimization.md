We adjust the ESI (electrospray ionization) parameters of a LC-MS/MS to increase the sensitivity of analytes during the method development and validation stage.

There are many parameters, such as: gas temperature, gas flow, sheath gas temperature, sheath gas flow, capillary voltage, nozzle voltage, and nebulizer pressure. 


## How to optimize the ESI parameters?
two approaches:  
1) one parameter at a time.  
It is empirical, but it overlooks the interactions between parameters.  The design of experiments approach can overcome it. Furthermore, when the lack of standards is a critical limitation for method development, the statistical approach is especially useful. [^1]   

2) Design of experiments approach
