## Galak materials

Leakage problems are usually solved by tightening or replacing pipe joints. However, excessive tightening will wear the metal joints and plastic joints. If the leakage problem cannot be solved by slightly tightening the joint, the joint must be removed and rechecked the damage (for example, damaged sleeve, impurities on the sealing surface). The broken joint should be replaced.
