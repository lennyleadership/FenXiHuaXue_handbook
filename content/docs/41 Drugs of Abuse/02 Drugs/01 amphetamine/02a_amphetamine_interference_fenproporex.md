The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) warned consumers in January 2006 that the Brazilian dietary supplements Emagrece Sim and Herbathin contain several active drug ingredients including fenproporex, which is metabolized to amphetamine. Use of other weight loss or nutritional supplements containing fenproporex has resulted in detection of D-amphetamine in the urines of users.
