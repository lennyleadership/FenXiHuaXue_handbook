Accurate analysis of amphetamines by LC-MS/MS can be achieved using chiral columns, but the analysis presented here provides a simpler, more cost-effective approach for high-throughput labs. Excellent separation of all enantiomers in urine was obtained in a fast, 7-min quantitative analysis on a Raptor C18 column with no interference from matrix components.

## Introduction
Amphetamine and methamphetamine are psychostimulant drugs that occur as two enantiomers, dextrorotary and levorotary, as a result of their chiral center. <u>The dextromethamphetamine (d-isomer) form is highly abused and typically found in illicit preparations</u>. However, detection of abuse is complicated because consumption of over-the-counter and prescription medications may yield positive results if the analytical method used cannot distinguish between the d- and l- enantiomers. Chiral separation of d- and l-methamphetamine and their metabolites d- and l-amphetamine (Figure 1) can help determine whether the source was licit or illicit, however, chiral columns can be expensive, may necessitate a dedicated instrument, and are not as broadly useful as ubiquitous C18 columns.
In order to provide labs with a high-throughput assay that effectively separates amphetamines by LC-MS/MS in urine without the use of a costly and specialized chiral column, we developed the following analysis on a standard reversed-phase Raptor C18 column. The method employs a simple precolumn derivatization followed by dilution and results in a selective, specific analysis of d- and l-amphetamine and methamphetamine enantiomers in urine that is free from sample matrix interferences.

## Sample Preparation

The trick is to use Marfey's reagent, 1-fluoro-2-4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide.  

**Analyte-free pooled human urine (BioIVT)** was fortified with d- and l-amphetamines and d- and l-methamphetamines (Cerilliant) to prepare seven calibration standards and four QC samples

50 μL of calibration standard or QC sample was aliquoted into a microcentrifuge tube. 10 μL of a working internal standard (20 μg/mL (±)-amphetamine-D11 and (±)-methamphetamine-D11 in water) and 20 μL of 1M NaHCO₃ was added and vortexed at 3000 rpm for 10 seconds. After vortexing, 100 μL of 0.1% (w/v) Marfey’s reagent (1-fluoro-2-4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanine amide) prepared in acetone was added, vortexed, and heated at 45 °C for 1 hour. Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature before the addition of 40 μL of 1M HCl in water. The sample was then vortexed and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at 45 °C. Samples were reconstituted in 1 mL of 40:60 water:methanol (v/v) and filtered using Thomson SINGLE StEP standard filter vials (cat.# 25893) and then injected.
