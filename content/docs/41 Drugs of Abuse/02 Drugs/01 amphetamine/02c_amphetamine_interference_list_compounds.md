Positive amphetamines results may be also be observed due to ingestion of medications containing amphetamine, methamphetamine, or compounds metabolized to these compounds. Amphetamine [Dexedrine (D-amphetamine), Adderall (D- and L-amphetamine), etc.] and methamphetamine [Desoxyn (D-methamphetamine)] are the active compounds of medications prescribed for appetite suppression, narcolepsy, and attention-deficit disorder and ingestion of these drugs will result in true-positive results due to excretion of these compounds in the urine. Table 16.1 lists compounds whose ingestion can cause positive results due to metabolism to amphetamine and/or methamphetamine.
