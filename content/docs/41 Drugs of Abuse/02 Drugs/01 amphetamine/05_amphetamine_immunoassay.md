## What are stimulants?
Two stimulants: amphetamine and methamphetamine  

Designer amphetamines: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; Ecstasy), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and 3-4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA)

Other sympathomimetic amines (see Fig. 16.1) with similar structures include compounds such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.   

Additional designer amphetamines are: methiopropamine, 4-fluoroamphetamine, 4-fluoromethamphetamine, 4-methylamphetamine, and cathinones.

## Issues
Because of the structural similarity of the other sympathomimetic amines, cross-reactivity of antibodies is a primary concern when interpreting results of immunoassay screening for amphetamines.  

Current immunoassays are extremely effective for the detection of the intended compounds such as amphetamine/methamphetamine or MDMA/MDA, but are typically ineffective for use in detecting new amphetamine designer drugs [5].
