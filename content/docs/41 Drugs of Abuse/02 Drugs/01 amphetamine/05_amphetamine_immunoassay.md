Immunoassays detect substances above a set threshold using antibodies[1] [2].  While a useful tool, immunoassays have poor specificity that may lead to false-positive results [1-3].

Structure similarity to amphetamine or methanphetamine creates potential problems due to cross-reactivity of the antibodies in immunoassays.
