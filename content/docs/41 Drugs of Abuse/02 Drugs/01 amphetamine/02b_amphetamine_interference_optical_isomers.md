Amphetamine and methamphetamine have optical isomers designated D (or +) for dextrorotatory and L (or -) for levorotatory and the D-isomers, the more physiologically active compounds, are the intended targets of immunoassays. Ingestion of medications containing the L-isomer can cause false-positive results. For example, Vicks inhaler contains the active ingredient L-methamphetamine [17] and extensive use of this product may cause false-positive results for immunoassay screening. Specific isomer resolution procedures must be performed to differentiate the D- and L-isomers.
