Because mass spectrometric procedures using nonchiral derivatives and columns do not differentiate the D (+) or L (-) isomers of amphetamine and methamphetamine, it is necessary to perform isomer resolution to determine that a positive result is due to the presence of the D-isomer. Primary examples are the presence of L-methamphetamine in Vicks inhaler, which cannot be distinguished from the use of illicit methamphetamine (D-isomer or racemic mixture depending on method of production) and the excretion of L-methamphetamine and L-amphetamine by patients taking selegiline for Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Isomer resolution can be accomplished using a chiral, optically active column, or chiral derivatizing reagents [9]. Use of chiral derivatizing reagents allows analysis on instrument/column systems used for other routine analyses but has the potential disadvantage of possibly obtaining four isomers instead of two if the derivatizing agent is not optically pure. The generally accepted interpretation of isomer resolution results is that >80% of the L-isomer is considered consistent with the use of legitimate medication or conversely >20% of the D-isomer (and total concentration above the cutoff) is considered evidence of illicit use [8,18].
