## L-isomer

Amphetamine and methamphetamine have optical isomers designated D (or +) for dextrorotatory and L (or -) for levorotatory and the D-isomers, the more physiologically active compounds, are the intended targets of immunoassays. Ingestion of medications containing the L-isomer can cause false-positive results. For example, Vicks inhaler contains the active ingredient L-methamphetamine [17] and extensive use of this product may cause false-positive results for immunoassay screening. Specific isomer resolution procedures must be performed to differentiate the D- and L-isomers.

## List of interference compounds

Positive amphetamines results may be also be observed due to ingestion of medications containing amphetamine, methamphetamine, or compounds metabolized to these compounds. Amphetamine [Dexedrine (D-amphetamine), Adderall (D- and L-amphetamine), etc.] and methamphetamine [Desoxyn (D-methamphetamine)] are the active compounds of medications prescribed for appetite suppression, narcolepsy, and attention-deficit disorder and ingestion of these drugs will result in true-positive results due to excretion of these compounds in the urine. Table 16.1 lists compounds whose ingestion can cause positive results due to metabolism to amphetamine and/or methamphetamine.

## Gabapentin

**Introduction**  
An amphetamine interference was observed during the development of an liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS) multi-class confirmation method for the determination of 47 drugs and metabolites in urine. The interference passed all qualitative criteria for amphetamine leading to potential false-positive results. Upon investigation, it was found that the amphetamine interference was correlated with the presence of high levels of **gabapentin**. Gabapentin is routinely detected in patient urine specimens at levels in excess of 1 mg/mL as it is widely prescribed at high doses and does not undergo significant metabolism. The source of the interference was identified as a gabapentin in-source fragment isomeric with protonated amphetamine.

## Fenproporex  

The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) warned consumers in January 2006 that the Brazilian dietary supplements Emagrece Sim and Herbathin contain several active drug ingredients including fenproporex, which is metabolized to amphetamine. Use of other weight loss or nutritional supplements containing fenproporex has resulted in detection of D-amphetamine in the urines of users.
