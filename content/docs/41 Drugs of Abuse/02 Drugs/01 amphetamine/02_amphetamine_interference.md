An amphetamine interference was observed during the development of an liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS) multi-class confirmation method for the determination of 47 drugs and metabolites in urine. The interference passed all qualitative criteria for amphetamine leading to potential false-positive results. Upon investigation, it was found that the amphetamine interference was correlated with the presence of high levels of **gabapentin**. Gabapentin is routinely detected in patient urine specimens at levels in excess of 1 mg/mL as it is widely prescribed at high doses and does not undergo significant metabolism. The source of the interference was identified as a gabapentin in-source fragment isomeric with protonated amphetamine.
