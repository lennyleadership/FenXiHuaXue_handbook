The term ‘bath salts’ is used to describe a large variety of synthetic drugs. Although many bath salts are derived from a naturally-occurring amphetamine-like compound found in the Khat plant, it is difficult to predict what substances will be found in any product labeled ‘bath salts’. People who are exposed to bath salts exhibit similar effects as those who are exposed to methamphetamine or designer amphetamines.
