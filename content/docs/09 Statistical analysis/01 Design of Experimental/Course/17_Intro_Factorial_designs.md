Analyzing several factors simultaneously: factorial designs.  

Many experiments involve this study of two or more factors,  
) like temperature, pH and concentration during an enzymatic reaction;  
) the route and the hour of the day on the total time to commute from home to work;  
) and sugar and butter amounts  and oven temperature in a cookie recipe.   

A factorial design means that in `each complete trial` or `replicate` of the experiment, all possible combinations of the levels of the factors will be investigated.

If there are "a" levels of factor A and "b" levels of factor B, each complete replicate will involve  ab treatments,  and we call it a `crossed factorial design`.
