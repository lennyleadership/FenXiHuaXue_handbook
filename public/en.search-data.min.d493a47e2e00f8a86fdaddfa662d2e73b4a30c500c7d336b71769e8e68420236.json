So the appropriate data will be collected and analyzed by statistical methods, resulting in invalid and objective conclusions. When the problem involves data that are subject to experimental errors, statistical methods are the only objective approach to the analysis. The design of experiments is based on three basic principles. Randomization, replication, and blocking.\nRandomization means that both the allocation of experimental material and the order in which the individual runs will be performed are randomly determined.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the example of a cooker that wishes to develop the best apple pie. First, the cooker goes to the market and buys a batch of apples. Then he uses half of the apples to make an apple pie using recipe one and the other half to make a pie using recipe two. However, he had made the pie with recipe one two days after buying the apples, while the pie with recipe two seven days after buying the apples. The apples where at a different ripening stage. Now, if there are differences between the pies, it can be because of the recipe, but also because of the ripening stage of the apples. The allocation of experimental material was not randomized.\nRandomization is the cornerstone underlying the use of statistical methods in the experimental design. It assures that the errors are independently distributed among the runs.\nReplication. Replication means an independent repeat run of each factor combination.\nIf the cooker from the previous example get some apples and use them to make a batch of three pies using recipe one, does the cooker have three replications of the apple pie with recipe one? No, these are not replications, they are repeated measures. Replication means an independent repeat run of each factor combination. To have three replications, the cooker has to do one pie using recipe one, then another one from scratch, And then a third one from scratch again. Now the cooker has three independent replications.\nThe replications reflect the sources of variability of the system. In this case, how much the pies of the same recipe differ from each other.\nBlocking. Blocking is used to eliminate the variability transmitted by nuisance factors.\nImagine that the cooker can only make two pies each day. Then, he buys a batch of apples and makes one pie using recipe one and one pie using recipe two. Another day, The cooker again buys a batch of apples and makes one pie using recipe one and one pie using recipe two. In this case, the pies are divided into blocks. Each block is a different batch of apples at a different day.\nGenerally, a block is a set of relatively homogeneous experimental conditions. The concept and the use of blocks in the design of experiments will be discussed in deep in Section 7 of this course.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/98-example/table-of-contents/without-toc/","title":"Without ToC","section":"Table of Contents","content":"At me ipso nepotibus nunc celebratior genus #  Tanto oblite #  Lorem markdownum pectora novis patenti igne sua opus aurae feras materiaque illic demersit imago et aristas questaque posset.

The discussion will lead to a review of several statistical concepts. And the engineer aims to evaluate if the addition of a polymer emulsion in a cement mortar affects the tension bond strength of the product. The experimenter has collected 10 observations of the modified formulation and 10 observations of the unmodified one. Looking into the table of results, each observation is called a run, and the differences among the individual runs in the same treatment is called noise or experimental error or simply error. The noise or error arises from an uncontrolled variation that is generally unavoidable. By plotting the experimental data in a dot diagram, we can visualize the central trend of each treatment, with the average strength of then modified formulation being slightly higher than the one of the formulation of the polymer and also the simple variability, meaning how much that the data is spread around the average.\nNote: 10 observations were not repeated runs.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/04_sampling_sample_properties/","title":"04 Sampling and Sample Properties","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"Before going further in this example, let\u0026rsquo;s talk a little bit about sampling and sample properties. Consider the following: For a science fair, a student, determined the average height of his or her classmates. The response variable, The thing that this tool than this measuring is the height. As the classmates have different heights, We can characterize the data by the average or mean: the sum of all observations divided by the total number of observations, and by the variance: the difference between each individual observation and the mean, to the square. The variance measures the spread of the population around the mean. In this case, this student used the whole population of the classroom to determine the mean height and the height variability.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now consider a modified example: for scientific study a research group aims to determine the average height of grade eight students in Canada. However, there are almost three hundred and fifty thousand students in grade eight. Is it really necessary to measure the height of all students? No, it isn\u0026rsquo;t. As the number of students is very large, they will estimate the average height by using a random sample. A certain number of students will be randomly chosen to represent the population and then they can estimate the average height and the variance of the population by using the average and the variance of the sample. The sample mean is a point estimator of the population mean, and the sample variance is a point estimator of the population variance. In a random sample, each individual observation can be described by the mean, plus a random error. And experimental result shows that the individual observations in a random sample usually follow a normal distribution around the mean.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/05_hypothesis_testing/","title":"05 Hypothesis Testing (t-Test \u0026 F-Test)","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"Now, going back to our initial problem: the results from an experiment are considered as a sample of the population. From the data we know that the sample mean of the unmodified formulation is slightly higher than the sample mean from modified one. However, the observed difference in the average results is due to the polymer addition or is due to the noise the system? In other words, is the difference significant? To answer this question, we are going to use a statistical technique called hypothesis testing. We are going to test two hypothesis: The null hypothesis, H0, that states that the means are equal, in our case, that the polymer addition does not affect the strength. And the alternative hypothesis, H1, that states that the means are different, in our case, the polymer addition does affect the strength.\nSuppose that we can assume that the variances of the tension bond strength are the same for both formulations, then the appropriate statistical test to compare them is the two-sample t-test.\n\r\rThe quantity t0 is calculated using the sample means and variances, and then compared to the t-distribution curve. The null hypothesis will be considered true, meaning the means are equal if the absolute value of t0 is smaller than a critical t. For a significance level alpha, For a significance level alpha, it is expected that $100(1-\\alpha)$% of t0 values to fall between minus t-critical -t$\\alpha$/2, n_1+n_2-2 and plus t-critical +t$\\alpha$/2, n_1+n_2-2. The values of t-critical can be read in a table using the significance level and the number of observations. However, as we are going to use statistical software for our analysis, we are not going to use tables.\nThis new term, the significance level alpha, is the probability of type I error, that is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. In our example, the probability of stating that the polymer does affect the result when it does not. We usually set alpha at 0.05 or 5%. And now one last detail before analyzing the two formulations of our example. The two-sample t-Test is applied for samples with equal variances. So we are going to check if the variances are equal or not. And the appropriate way is by using the F-test. Consider that we have a random sample of apples from Farm 1, with $n_1$ observations and variance $S_1$ to the square ($S_1^2$), and a random samples from Farm 2, with $n_2$ observations and variance $S_2$ to the square ($S_2^2$). If the two populations of apples from the two farms have the same variance, then $\\sigma_1^2$ = $\\sigma_2^2$, $\\sigma$ (sigma) is the variance of the populations, and the ratio between the two sample variances follows an $F_{n_1-1, n_2-1}$(F-distribution for $n_1$ minus 1 and $n_2$ minus 1 degrees of freedom). In practice, we are going to consider that the null hypothesis is true, meaning the variances of the populations are equal, if the ratio between the sample variances is lower than a critical F. In the same way of the t-Test, the values of the critical F can be read in the F-distribution tables for each significance level by crossing the degrees of freedom of the two samples.\nNow we have everything we need to compare the two formulations. We are going to use Microsoft Excel for this analysis. Please download the Microsoft Excel file cement and let\u0026rsquo;s change to Microsoft Excel to start the analysis.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/06-Method-Development-and-Validation/","title":"Method Development and Validation","section":"Docs","content":".\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/06_compare_means/","title":"08 Comparing Treatment Means","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"After performing the analysis of variance, we know that the cotton percentage affects the tensile strength at a p-value of 9×10-6.

Also, there is some overlap between the results at 15 and 20 percent and there is a large overlap between the results at 20 and 25 percent. Thus, the question that arises is “Which results are different, and which ones are similar?”. First, we will compare the means graphically. The graph on the left shows the results between 15 and 30 percent as a t-distribution of the treatment results. To visualize them better, we have them expanded in pairs. Now, what are we looking for? Overlaps. If the overlap between two distribution curves is small or nonexistent, We see the results or averages are different, as 15 and 20%, 15 and 25%, 15 and 30%, and 20 and 30%.

The example analyzed two cement formulations, with or without polymer. Another way to describe this experiment is as a single factor experiment with two levels of the factor. However, many single factor experiments involve more than two levels of the factor. This section focuses on methods for the design and the analysis of single factor experiments with an arbitrary number of the levels of the factor.\nWe are going to start directly by analyzing an example that is the development of a new synthetic fiber that will be used to make cloth for men\u0026rsquo;s shirts. The objective is to maximize the cloth tensile strength. The tensile strength of a fabric is the measure of the maximum pulling force it can support before it breaks. From previous experience, we know that the tensile strength is affected by the weight percentage of cotton. We also know that probably any increase in the cotton content will increase the tensile strength and that the cotton content should range between 10 and 40% due to limitations in the process. This way, it was designed an experiment to test 5 levels of cotton content, between 15 and 35% with five replicates. This is an example of a single factor experiment where the number of levels \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; is five. The number of replicates \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; is five also. And we have a total of 25 observations. Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose we can run only 5 tests per day. Thus, we can run all the experiments with 15% on Monday, The experiments with 20% on Tuesday, the ones with 25% on Wednesday. On Thursday, the ones with 30%. And finally on Friday, the ones with 35%. However, this is a really bad way of organizing and running the experiments, since the effect of the cotton percentage is confounded with the day. But why this is a problem? We don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe on Tuesday there was a problem with the scales and all the samples that should have 20% had 22. Maybe the relative humidity on Wednesday was higher. And the fact that the measurements of the tensile strength, or maybe even the experimenter had some personal issues and was distracted on Monday. The bottom line is we don\u0026rsquo;t know. That\u0026rsquo;s why we have to randomize the tests, meaning that the experiments should be run in random order, guaranteeing that the experimental noise is equally distributed among the runs. An efficient way to generate the random order is to enter the 25 runs in a spreadsheet like Excel and generate the column of random numbers using the RAND() function. Or we can always write the test numbers in small pieces of paper, fold and sort. The table on the right shows the randomized test order. This random test sequence is needed to prevent the effects of unknown noise variables, perhaps varying out of control during the experiment, from contaminating the results. The table on the left now shows the experimental results.\nIt is always a good idea to examine experimental data graphically. The figure on the right shows the scatter diagram where we can easily see the noise or variability of the results. We can also see that between 15 and 30% there is an increase in the tensile strength with the cotton content. And after that, a sharp decrease. However, we wish to be more objective in our analysis of the data. Specifically, suppose that we wish to test for differences between the average result of each level of cotton percentage. The appropriate procedure for testing the equality of several means is the analysis of variance. is the analysis of variance. However, the analysis of variance has a much wider application than the problem above. It is probably the most useful technique in the field of statistical inference.\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/08_One_way_ANOVA/","title":"One-Way ANOVA","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"For the analysis of variance it is useful to describe the observations using a statistical model.\n\rHypotheses test: \r$H_1: \\tau_i \\neq 0$ for at least one i\r\r\r\r In the effects model Each observation $y_{ij}$ can be represented by an overall mean, $\\mu$, plus the effect of the ith treatment, $\\tau_i$, plus a random error, $\\epsilon_{ij}$. The effects model is not the only model to be used to represent the data. However, it has some intuitive appeal in that the average $\\mu$ is a constant, and the treatment effects $\\tau_i$ represent the deviation from this constant when the specific treatments are applied. This model is called single factor analysis of variance or one-way ANOVA. As the treatment effects can be considered as a deviation from the overall mean, The hypothesis test for the one way analysis of variance can be expressed in terms of the treatment effect $\\tau_i$. In the null hypothesis $\\tau_i$ is equal zero for every i. That is the effect of the factor is zero, there is no deviation from the overall mean.

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026quot;2014-09-28\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;creating a new theme\u0026quot; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions #  There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins #  Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page #  The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File #  When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent #  Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter #  The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown #  Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files #  Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template #  A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template #  A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template #  A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site #  Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme.

Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content.

We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme #  Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton #  Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.  The Home Page #  Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends.

It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely.

Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory #  When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option #  Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload #  Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage #  The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts #  We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File #  $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026quot;tag\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

We call these levels low and high, and we use the minus and plus signs to identify them. To make it easier, let\u0026rsquo;s take the example of the effect of the route and the hour of the day on the total time to commute from home to work. In this case, Factor A is the time we leave home, can be seven or eight a.m.. Factor B is the route we take, R1 or R2, and our response is the commute time in minutes.\nThe effect of a factor is defined as the change in the response produced by a change in the level of the factor. We call it main effect because it refers to the primary factors of interest in the experiment. In our example, the effect of factor A, the time we leave home, is the average commute time we take when we leave at eight a.m., minus the average time when we leave at seven a.m., 21 minutes. In the same way, the effect of the route is the average time we take when we use route 2, minus the average time when we use route 1: 11 minutes. The effects graph can easily illustrate this behavior. Here we see that leaving that eight a.m. causes an average increase of 21 minutes in the commute time compared to seven a.m. and using route two causes an average increase of eleven minutes in the commute time compared to route one.\nIn some experiments we may find that the difference in the response between the levels of one factor is not the same at all levels of the other factors. In this modified example, the leaving time has a positive effect when using route 1, meaning that we take more time to go to work, if we leave at eight a.m., but the leaving time has a negative effect when using route 2, meaning that we take less time to go to work if we leave at eight a.m.. Because the effect of the leaving time depends on the route we say that there is an interaction between them: the effect of the leaving time at route 1 is 30 minutes, and the effect of the leaving time at route 2 is -28 minutes. Interactions between factors can be easily spotted in graphs, in the graph on the left, the increase in the commute time by leaving that eight a.m. is roughly the same using either route one or route two, there is no interaction and the lines showing the effect of the leaving time are approximately parallel. However, the graphs on the right tell a completely different story. In the upper graph, the living time has a weak or small effect when using route one, but a strong effect when using route two. In the lower graph, the leaving time has a positive effect when using route one, meaning the commute time increases by leaving at eight a.m., and has a negative effect when using route two, meaning the commute time decreases when leaving that eight a.m.. In both cases, the effect of the leaving time on the commute depends on the route, showing a clear interaction between them.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/19_why_use_factorial_design/","title":"19 Why Using Factorial Design?","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"Why using factorial designs? Which are the advantages of factorial designs? Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose you have an experimental space with factors A and B, and we wish to maximize the response or outcome of the system. To make it easier, let\u0026rsquo;s say that our response is the yield of a chemical process with temperature and pH. Our first approach is testing one factor at a time, and our first experiment will be at 30 degrees and pH 4, and the yield was 25. Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to increase the temperature to 50 degrees and the yield was 15. Now we know that the temperature has a negative effect on the yield. So we\u0026rsquo;ll go back to 30 degrees and test the pH. At 30 degrees and pH 6, the yield is 30, and we know that the pH has a positive effect on the yield. And this is probably our best result. What we have missed is that this system is non-linear and there is an interaction between the temperature and the pH, as shown by the contour lines. When testing one-factor-at-a-time, we miss the information about interactions. And in this case, we have missed the area of the highest yield in our experimental space. By doing a factorial design, with only one more experiment it is possible to increase the information on the true behaviour of the system. Now we know that the temperature has a positive effect at pH 6, but the temperature has a negative effect at pH 4. And the pH has a weak effect at 30 degrees and a strong effect at 50 degrees. A factorial design is always necessary when interactions may be present in the system to avoid misleading conclusions. To optimize a system using one-factor-at-a-time we need luck, to optimize a system using factorial designs we only need method.\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/20_Two_factor_factorial_designs/","title":"20 Two-Factor Factorial Designs","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look in this example of a Two-Factor factorial design. A researcher needs to design a battery to be use in extreme temperature variations. There are three choices of materials to be tested. Once the batteries in use, there is no control over the temperature that the device will encounter. And it is well known that the temperature affects effective battery life. The battery should be robust to temperature variation. The following questions must be answered. What effect the material type and temperature have on the life of the battery? And is there a choice of material that would give uniformly long life despite the temperature? The table shows the factorial design performed. This is the simplest type of crossed factorial design since it involves only two factors. Factor A tested at a levels. Factor B test at b levels. Each replicate of the experiments contains all ab treatment combinations, and there are n replicates. In our case, the material type is factor A. tested at three levels each. The temperature is our factor B, also tested at three levels each. The number of different treatments is nine. We have four observations per cell, the number of replicates is 4, and the total number of observations is 36. The order that the abn observations are taken is selected at random: This is a completely randomized design. In the same way of the one-way ANOVA, we can use the effects models to describe the experimental observations. In this case each individual result $y_ijk$ can be described by the overall mean, plus the effect of factor A, plus the effect of factor B, plus the effect of the interaction AB plus a random error. The analysis of variance will test the effects of A, B, and the interaction AB. So the analysis of variance table presents the total variability of the data split into the variability of factor A, factor B, and the interaction. In our particular case, material, temperature and the interaction between material and temperature. Each one of these sources of variations will be compared to the error by using the F-test, that is the ratio between the mean squares of a factor or interaction and the mean squares of the error.

To remember, a factor or interaction is significant F-zero is higher than the critical F, meaning that the p-value is lower than the significance level alpha, usually 0.05. Before going further, it is important to point out that the critical F is not the same for all the tests. This is because of the different degrees of freedom of each term. The analysis of variance will help us to answer the following questions: first, do the different materials affect the battery life? And the answer is yes, they do. F-zero is higher than F critical, and p-value is lower than 0.05. Second question, does the temperature affect the battery life? And again, the answer is yes it does. However, we already knew it from the statement of the problem. It is well known that the temperature affects the effective battery life. The real question here is the following: Is there a choice of material that would give us uniformly long-life, despite the temperature? This way, the test with temperature, was not to see if the temperature affected the battery life, but to see if the effect of the temperature on the battery life was different for different materials. And the answer and again is: Yes, it is. The behaviour of the battery life with temperature depends on the material. To visualize this behaviour, we have the final results presented as a table, with mean and standard deviation, And as a plot. In the graph, it is easy to visualize that the battery life decreases with temperature for all materials, but the behavior is different and for material 1 compared to materials 2 and 3.\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/23_Means_comparison_Tukey_test/","title":"23 Means Comparison by Tukey's Test and Final Conclusion","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"After that analysis of variance, the next step is to compare the treatment means using Tukey\u0026rsquo;s test.

Tukey\u0026rsquo;s test compares the difference between two means to a limit value T-alpha to state if they are significantly different or not. The limit value T depends on the significance level, the number of treatments, the degrees of freedom of the error, the mean squares of the error and the number of replicates. The q-value can be read in a specific table, as we have already seen. This way, our calculated T-value is 61.9. Now we are going to compare the results for each temperature to decide if the behavior of the materials differ or not. At -10ºC, the battery life is similar for all materials, since the difference between them is lower than 61.9. At 20ºC, material 1 has a shorter battery life than materials 2 and 3; and that 50ºC, again, there is no difference between the materials. It is pointless to compare the temperature within the materials, since we have no control over it, we cannot choose the best temperature, we can only choose the best material.

Each one of these factors is tested at two levels each: the low level and the high level.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s recall the example of the previous section when we had the effects of the route and the hour of the day when the total time to commute from home to work. We studied two leaving times, 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. and two routes, route 1 and route 2, in the total commute time in minutes. The leaving time is a numeric factor: I can leave 7 a.m., I can leave 8 a.m, or I can leave any time between seven and eight, like 7:30. However, the route is a categorical factor: I can use either Route 1 or Route 2. There is nothing between. There is no route 1 and 3/4. There is no route 1 and 3/4. If the factors are analyzed at two levels each, a complete replicate of the design requires 2 the power of k runs. That\u0026rsquo;s why it is called two in the power of k factorial designs. Let\u0026rsquo;s take the example of two factors: temperature and substrate concentration, the design will involve 4 experiments, k is equal 2. If I add a third factor, like the pH, the temperature-substrate design will be tested at pH 5 and ph 7.5, If I add a third factor, like the pH, the temperature substrate design will be tested at pH 5 and pH 7.5, And I will have 8 experiments: 2 in the power of 3. If I add a fourth factor, like the stirring rate, the eight experiments of the pH, temperature and substrate design will be tested at the two stirring rates: 200 rpm and 400 rpm; and I have 16 experiments: 2 in the power of 4. Finally, if I study two types of substrate, like glucose and sucrose, the 16 experiments will become 32, two in the power of five. In this example, we have four numerical factors temperature, substrate concentration, pH and stirring rate, and one categorical factor, the substrate type. The substrate can be either numerical or categorical. If I am studying the substrate concentration, I have a numerical factor. If I am studying the substrate type, I have a categorical factor.

Nuisance factors are factors that probably affect the results, but we are not interested in their effect. Sometimes a nuisance factor is unknown and uncontrolled. We don\u0026rsquo;t know that the factor exists, and it may even be changing levels while we are conducting the experiment. They are responsible for the experimental error.

However, we don\u0026rsquo;t use blocks in the regression model. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense as you are not able to repeat a specific block. We cannot choose the best block conditions and run them again. Moreover, we haven\u0026rsquo;t even identified any potential source of variability among the blocks or replicates. If the blocks are significant, we probably won\u0026rsquo;t know why. So let\u0026rsquo;s run it.\nNow, our data file has two new variables, Factor_S and Factor_E, and these new variables Factor_S and Factor_E are factors with two levels each, and the block variable, the block column, is also a factor, with three levels each. is not numerical anymore.\nNow we are ready for `the analysis of variance`. In the analysis of variance we have the yield, our response, as a function of the blocks plus Factor_S times Factor_E The star means that Factor_S, Factor E, and the interaction between them will be tested. So let's run it. Here we have the resulting ANOVA table. We are going to transfer these results to the presentation to analyze them. Then table shows the sum of squares, the degrees of freedom, the mean squares, the F-zero and the p-value for the substrate, the enzyme, the interaction the error and for the blocks.\nIn this case, substrate and enzyme are significant. The same result that we have previously. Looking for the blocks, the degrees of freedom of the blocks is two, the number of blocks, three, minus one. Looking for the blocks, the degrees of freedom of the blocks is two, the number of blocks, three, minus one. And the p-value shows that the blocks are not significant. It is kind of expected that the blocks were not significant.\nIn fact, we have used the same data of the completely randomized design split into blocks. We could use an artificial block effect to analyze it. But we are not doing it now. They're going to do it for the next example. A factorial design confounded in blocks. The next steps would be to build the regression model, to check the model adequacy and to build the contour plots. However, we have already done it previously. So we won't do it again. Anyway, the code needed is in the txt file. Feel free to run it before continuing in our next lesson."},{"id":29,"href":"/docs/09-Design-of-Experiments/Course/45_confounding_design_blocks/","title":"45 Confounding a 2^k Design in Blocks","section":"Design of Experiments","content":"We have just seen that when it is not possible to run a factorial design in homogeneous conditions, we can run each replicate in a block. However, sometimes even a complete replicate doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit in one block. In this case, we can use a technique called confounding to split the complete replicate in two or more blocks.\nThe determination of confounding means that certain effects, usually high-order interactions, will be indistinguishable, or confounded with the blocks.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the following example. Imagine a single replicate of a 2^2 design, we have four treatments. (1), a, b and ab. However, we have a limitation. The equipment allows only two runs at a time. This way we have to split the four treatments in two blocks and each set of two runs will be one block. But how can we divide four treatments in two blocks? To help with doing a smart choice we are going to use the table of plus and minus signs for the 2^2 design. As the name says, the table of plus and minus signs shows the plus and minus signs of the treatments for calculating the factorial effects of the main factors and interactions.\nThe first column presents the treatments. In the second column we have the identity column with only plus signs; and then we have the main effects columns. In this case, factor A and factor B. The plus and minus signs in this main effect columns are the same ones of the coded variables. For factor A the treatments were a is at high level, a and ab, have a plus sign, and the treatments where A is at low level, treatments (1) and b, the treatments have a minus sign. And the same applies for factor B. A is at low level, treatments one and B, the treatments have a minus sign. And the same applies for factor B. Now, the interaction AB. The signs of the column AB can be given by the multiplication of the signs of factor a and factor B for each treatment. For treatment (1): minus times minus is a plus. For treatment a plus times minus is a minus; for B, minus and plus is a minus; and AB, plus plus we have a plus. As you have probably guessed already, the table of plus and minus signs is used to calculate the contrasts. Contrast of a is given by ab plus a minus b minus (1). Contrast of B: ab plus b minus b minus one; and contrast of AB: ab plus one minus a minus b. When we calculated the contrast of AB some lessons ago, I haven\u0026rsquo;t explained how the treatment signs were chosen, but now you know it, they come from the table of plus and minus signs. Let\u0026rsquo;s now split the treatments in two blocks. As a first attempt, let\u0026rsquo;s use the order in the table to divide the treatments. In block one we will have treatment (1) and treatment a, and then block two treatment b and treatment ab. treatment b and treatment ab. treatment b and treatment ab. The contrast of the blocks can be calculated by the difference between the blocks. In this case ab plus b, minus a minus (1). If you look carefully at the contrast of the block is equal to the contrast of the main factor B, meaning that the blocks are confounded with factor B. We cannot distinguish the effect of the blocks from the effect of factor B. Confounding the blocks with main effects is, by far, the worst way of splitting a design. Blocks must never be confounded with main effects. Then how can we do with? How can we divide these four treatments in two blocks? If we cannot confound the blocks with the main effects, in this case, the only choice that we have is confound the blocks with the interaction AB, meaning that we are going to make the contrast of the blocks to be equal to the contrast of AB. Thus block one will be formed by treatments (1) and ab, the treatments with the plus sign in the AB column; and block two by treatments a and b, the treatments with the minus sign in the AB column. Now the contrast of the blocks are ab plus (1) minus a minus b, the same contrast of the interaction AB. Now the contrast of the blocks are ab plus (1) minus a minus b, the same contrast of the interaction AB. Now the blocks are confounded with the interaction AB and not with a main effect.\n"},{"id":30,"href":"/docs/50-MS-Based-Metabolomics/","title":"Mass Spectrometry Based Metabolomics","section":"Docs","content":"This is the root of Mass Spectrometry Based Metabolomics.\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/docs/94-Database/","title":"DataBase","section":"Docs","content":"This is the root of DataBase.\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/docs/95-Literature-Reading/","title":"Literature Reading","section":"Docs","content":".\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/docs/96-Physiochemistry-Theory/","title":"Physiochemistry Theory","section":"Docs","content":"material, hydrophobic, hydrophillic.\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/docs/98-example/","title":"Example Site","section":"Docs","content":"Introduction #  Ferre hinnitibus erat accipitrem dixi Troiae tollens #  Lorem markdownum, a quoque nutu est quodcumque mandasset veluti.

And thank you for joining us today for this session of LC Ms. Ms. 101. The fundamentals. Today we\u0026rsquo;ll share knowledge are on the fundamentals of both chromatography and mass spectrometry, as well as explain key terms and analytical techniques associated with this technology. I\u0026rsquo;m Crystal Holt with sai x and I am your moderator for today. And today I am joined with our speaker, Dr. Karl Oetjen. Thanks for joining Karl. Dr. Karl oetjen is a senior scientist driving food environmental, forensic, clinical and cannabis applications at sciex. Before joining sciex He completed his PhD at Colorado School of Mines in hydraulic science and engineering were his research focused on nontargeted characterization of complex surfactant mixtures, including including aqueous film forming foams, which led to the discovery of several novel per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances also known as PFS, that since they\u0026rsquo;ve been found in a variety of environmental samples and industrial chemicals. Since joining sex, Karl has worked with numerous labs creating and implementing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Thank you again for joining us. We hope you enjoyed the presentation. And I\u0026rsquo;ll turn it over to Karl.\nThank you so much, Crystal. And thanks, everybody for being here with me today. So today, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be really talking about some of those fundamentals. So the way I kind of designed this talk was to focus on folks who maybe are new to mass spec, or someone who has been doing some mass spec and just wants to kind of refresh on some of the key variables in mass spectrometry. So if we just take off our science hat for a moment, and think about how just the general public interacts, and views mass spectrometry, so probably friends family, they might be familiar with mass spectrometry, maybe from something like a TV show. And in fact, if you have told anyone you\u0026rsquo;re a chemist, within the last, probably say about seven years, they\u0026rsquo;ll probably responded with Oh, like breaking that. And that\u0026rsquo;s fair. They did use mass spectrometry in Breaking Bad to test the purity of methamphetamine. That\u0026rsquo;s true. But mass spectrometry affects our lives in a variety of ways beyond just testing, testing drugs in a fictional TV show. It impacts everything from studying previous cultures, to understanding if there\u0026rsquo;s life beyond Earth, keeping us alive when we go under anesthesia, and all the way down to keeping our food safe for our pets and family and friends. So regardless of whether you\u0026rsquo;re a chemist, or you\u0026rsquo;re just a regular person out and out in the grocery store, mass spectrometry affects their lives every day. So the first thing we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about is really the separation. So before we get to the mass spec, we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about the LLC portion. So this is really where the separation comes into play. In our next session, we\u0026rsquo;ll dive into some of the specifics. But here, this just kind of interior introduce some of these ideas. So in 1906, a Russian botanist first developed chromatography, and he was really interested in plant pigments. So he\u0026rsquo;s looking at pigments and plants. And that\u0026rsquo;s kind of where it chromatography gets its name. So it\u0026rsquo;s great for color writing. And since that discovery, it\u0026rsquo;s really branched into two specific fields. Or at least when we talk about organic analysis, two main fields, GC, and LC. So obviously, this presentation is going to really focus on LC, but maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve been familiar with GC, I know when I first started, I did a lot of gas chromatography. So maybe you\u0026rsquo;re switching over. And let\u0026rsquo;s just kind of touch on some of those key differences between gas chromatography and liquid chromatography. So the main difference that I would like to kind of instill is when we talk about gas chromatography, we really need our compounds to be volatile for that to be a reasonable approach for us to use, versus liquid chromatography, we need those compounds to be soluble. So that\u0026rsquo;s the really distinguishing factor of whether we\u0026rsquo;re going to go with a gas chromatography or GC approach versus an LC approach. Additionally, some kind of other interesting little facts for GC analysis, typically, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about relatively small compounds. Most of the time, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about sub 500 Daltons. So my background is in environmental science. So that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the area that I deal in. But I know many of you study things like polymers and proteins that are much much larger. So GC might not be great approach for those larger compounds really, isn\u0026rsquo;t it Compared to LC, where we can look at some of these really large compounds, so talking about things that are $100,000 Instead of just $500. But regardless of which approach you take, which one\u0026rsquo;s right for your sample, both are really quantitative. They\u0026rsquo;re both robust and reproducible. They\u0026rsquo;ve been around for a long time, and we use them all the time in the lab to complement each other. But let\u0026rsquo;s get into LLC. So what makes up an LLC, so let\u0026rsquo;s start with the top. First, we have our mobile phases. So we typically have two mobile phases. Our first mobile phase would be mobile phase A, this is typically some sort of aqueous mobile phase, and a second mobile phase, which will be commonly referred to as organic or mobile phase B. And the way we\u0026rsquo;re going to introduce these mobile phases into our system is via a pump. So I just drew a little diagram of a binary pump system here. So when I say binary pump, all I mean is that one pump is for the organic one pump is for the aqueous. So from our element bottles, we have our mobile phase moving into our degasser. And our degasser is simply doing exactly what it sounds like it\u0026rsquo;s doing, it\u0026rsquo;s removing gas. So maybe previously, you\u0026rsquo;ve seen people in the lab, Sonic eight Elio bottles to get the bolts out. With most modern systems, now we can just rely on this to gas or to get those bubbles out. So we don\u0026rsquo;t have to do that extra step. It\u0026rsquo;s then moving its way into the mixer, which is, again, doing exactly what it sounds like it\u0026rsquo;s doing, it\u0026rsquo;s mixing our two mobile phases together. And this is really important, though, we want to make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re mixing consistently, and we\u0026rsquo;re mixing accurately. So typically, these mixers are pretty small in size, somewhere between 20 and 100 microliters, depending on your application. So once we move past this step, our mobile phase is going to make its way into our auto sampler. And just like any other auto sampler, this is really just saving us time, right? I know when I first started doing analytical chemistry, for my masters, there was a instrument I needed to use. And we didn\u0026rsquo;t have an auto sampler. So I had the luxury of sitting there with a stopwatch and every 20 minutes injecting a sample. So it\u0026rsquo;s come a long way, and it\u0026rsquo;s great that it has. So what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is we\u0026rsquo;re withdrawing some of our sample for LCMS analysis we can do anywhere from around a microliter all the way up to a millimeter and above, depending on what kind of your method is and your approach and what detection limits you need. But regardless, we\u0026rsquo;re loading that sample into our sample loop. And from there, once our valve switches, our mobile phase is going to push our sample out of that sample loop and introduce it to our column. And our column, or analytical column is really where all the magic and separation is occurring. So we store that column within the column oven. And the reason we\u0026rsquo;re doing that is just to make sure it\u0026rsquo;s at a consistent temperature. As we increase temperature, typically what we see is a decreasing column pressure. And also our airlines are going to move a little bit faster through that column. So I\u0026rsquo;d hate to see you know, a column B outside of a column oven, and then your AC kick on and your room gets a little bit colder, that\u0026rsquo;s going to mess with your retention time. So keeping it in a column oven a little bit above your room temperature is usually what I would recommend. But our analytes are passing through that column. And this is their chance to really interact with that column in some way. So what we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to do, or what we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to how we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to choose a column rather is to have the analyte of interest interact differently than the Analyze we\u0026rsquo;re not interested in. And a really easy example of this would be salts, salts, or aspects were sending me, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to introduce them in the mass spec, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to analyze them anyway. So an HPLC column or just an LC Comm, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be really no interaction there with salts, so they\u0026rsquo;re going to immediately just pass through a column or analytes of interest are interacting with the stationary phase. And we can divert that to waste. But how are analytes interact with that stationary phase is going to depend a little bit. And it depends on a few factors. So here I have an equation for chromatographic resolution. And in the bottom in the red box, we have a lower resolution image and in the blue box, we have a higher resolution image. So what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do is separate our peaks with MSMS. This is not as important to say he V with UV analysis if for peaks were superimposed. There\u0026rsquo;s not much we can do in terms of integration and quantification, we really need to separate them. Whereas with MSMS, we can kind of get away with this a little bit. But regardless, we\u0026rsquo;re always trying to keep separation between our piece and the variables that we do for us to do this. One would be efficiency. So efficiency is the number of theoretical It\u0026rsquo;s kind of described the chromatographic band, but instead of thinking about it as a definition, I would rather us think about it as what factors are controlling that variable. So when we think about efficiency, some of the factors that really have a influence on that variable would be column length. So the longer a column, typically they\u0026rsquo;re anywhere from 50 millimeters to 150 millimeters, for just traditional HPLC. analysis. The longer that column is, the longer it\u0026rsquo;s going to take your analyte to move through that column. And that\u0026rsquo;s good thing, we\u0026rsquo;ll have more resolution as the column length increases or resolution increases, but it comes at a cost. And that cost usually is time. So if you have a 20 minute method, and using a longer column means you only have to add one or two minutes to your method, that might not be a big deal. But if you have a really short method, maybe three minutes, four minutes, adding a couple of minutes is, it\u0026rsquo;s a big difference, it could double the length of your minute or your method. So that\u0026rsquo;s something you kind of have to consider the same with particle size. So the way I like to think about particle size is with a larger particle size, we\u0026rsquo;ll have sort of wider peaks. And with a tighter particle size, we\u0026rsquo;re sort of sharpening up those peaks. So we\u0026rsquo;re increasing that area, or we\u0026rsquo;re increasing that height of the peak, essentially increasing the sensitivity, which again, great, some of the drawbacks are some of the compromises you need to make when you go to a smaller particle size would be column pressure, make sure your LLC can handle that sort of pressure. And also, if you have a really nasty matrix, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be talking about cannabis a little bit, which is just a truly awful matrix. The smaller the particle size, the more risk you have for running into things like clocks. Next would be retention. So retention is really controlled by your mobile phase. And that\u0026rsquo;s just the amount of column volumes it\u0026rsquo;s going to take for you to have your analyte of interest elute. So for LCMS analysis and HPLC analysis, we really focus on sort of like three major solvents are aqueous water, and methanol and acetic. Natural over next to common solvents that we\u0026rsquo;ve used in terms of inorganic, and they\u0026rsquo;re going to affect when your compound elutes a little bit differently. So there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of wiggle room there in terms of what you choose as your mobile phase, but probably one of the most important factors. And if you look at that graph, you can kind of see, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most important variables for chromatographic resolution would be your selectivity. And this is really your stationary phase, and how your compounds of interest and your comments that you\u0026rsquo;re not interested in, interact with your column. So during the mobile, the method development section, we\u0026rsquo;ll kind of go dive in deeper to specific column, stationary phases. But for now, I just kind of want to introduce some of the properties they\u0026rsquo;re using to interact with that stationary phase. So some of the more common techniques that are used would be hydrophobicity. So this is great for neutral compounds, versus something like a steric influence and a steric influence is really more dependent on your compounds structure. So different structures will interact differently with that stationary phase, you can then get into something like an H bonding, an H donating H accepting an H donating capacity. And those are going to work for different compounds. For each donating, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about sort of amines and amides more basis versus accepting, which we\u0026rsquo;re talking about more acids. But regardless, we really want to choose a column that works for your analytes. So this can be And admittedly, it was for me when I first started and one of the more tricky parts of LC analysis, choosing the column that\u0026rsquo;s right for your method. So there are a lot of really cool tools out. I particularly like this one from phenomics called ColumnMatch, not just because it has a funny name, but you can actually enter in the structures of the compounds you\u0026rsquo;re interested in. And it will give you suggestions on what stationary phase might be best for that type of analysis. But here would be a typical sort of chromatogram. So we have our peaks of interest. So all those colorful peaks represent individual analytes. This would be called an XIC, or an extracted ion chromatogram. We\u0026rsquo;re looking at a specific experiment, specific transitions, and we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about those experiments and then next couple slides. And in blue, we have our pressure trace. So our pump B pressure trace and if you remember from the earlier slide, that would be our organic pressure trace. And the reason I show pressure trace, instead of just percentage is because there\u0026rsquo;s pressure for pump the really core LEED silver is directly related to the percent B. So as we see the pressure increase, we\u0026rsquo;re introducing a higher amount of organic into our system. So a typical chromatogram, or typical LC gradient would have four phases, the first phase, we would start at a lower aqueous phase, so we\u0026rsquo;re introducing more water. Sometimes folks would choose to skip this step, it depends a little bit on your matrix, I like to include it just because that water will really help rinse off salts from your column and kind of ensure that it stays clean. But depending on the matrix, that might not be of concern. Next would be our ramping phase. So this sort of gradual ramp where our compounds are actually eluding, so we\u0026rsquo;re ramping from aqueous to organic, or compounds are beginning to elute. Then once their last compound has made its way off the column, we\u0026rsquo;ll hold it at a very high organic. And this is a really crucial step. So typically, we want to hold it anywhere from 95%. B, all the way up to 100%. B. And the reason we\u0026rsquo;re doing this is to essentially wash off the column. And the time it takes to wash off the column is kind of related to that retention. In the sense, we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the same variable, how many column volumes it\u0026rsquo;s going to take. So your column volume is related to your column dimensions, so the length, the inner diameter, etc. So we want to make sure we get at least two to three column volumes of organic through our column. And that\u0026rsquo;s just going to ensure that all of those other analytes, the ones we weren\u0026rsquo;t looking for have washed off for column, we\u0026rsquo;re keeping our column clean, and we can use it for many, many more injection. Once that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s done, we\u0026rsquo;re going to do the Aquila Bration phase, another really important phase, which again, is related to the dimensions of your column. So we want to make sure we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten all that organic out of her column, and are starting our next injection at the exact conditions, we started our first injection. So if we choose to skip this step, what would happen is our column won\u0026rsquo;t be a clue calibrated, and our peaks will slowly start to creep up in a chromatogram. And we really want to avoid that and make sure that we have these steady retention times. So if we go back into the lab, we talked about our chromatography, we\u0026rsquo;ve injected our sample, it\u0026rsquo;s gone through a column we have separation, it\u0026rsquo;s made its way to a mass spec. And now you get to do our mass spec analysis. So everything up into this point has just been introducing the sample to your mass spec. Now we get to use the mass spec selectivity to actually quantify and use the data. But first, what kind of data doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask that K bus. And in the simplest terms, the mass spec is really looking at a mass, we\u0026rsquo;re reading the mass, and we\u0026rsquo;re getting intensity at a specific time. And I say mass or molecular weight, but really it\u0026rsquo;s a m over z. So it\u0026rsquo;s the molecular weight over the charge. And we\u0026rsquo;ll go over what that means in a little bit. And give some examples of that. But since we\u0026rsquo;re talking about ms ms in this talk, we\u0026rsquo;ll also have some fragmentation information. So how do we use this data? What kind of questions can we answer with this data? Because that\u0026rsquo;s the whole reason we\u0026rsquo;re doing it right? We have a specific question. And we want an answer to that question. And that question might just be how much? So we might want to use this data for quantification, which is one of the more common uses from aspect or MSMS data. But we can also ask some more qualitative questions like what is this compound and do some confirmation scans that we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about to be confident? Yes, this is truly the compound that I\u0026rsquo;m interested in. But before we get there, we got to start at the source. So how do we take from our LC, this liquid and actually get it to move through a mass spectrometer. And to do that, we use ionization. So electrospray ionization is probably the most commonly used LCMS ionization type. And it was invented in 2002, by John Fenn, and some collaborators, and he was quoted as saying gave wings to molecular elephants, which is a quote I really like. Because if we think back to that GC, and LC diagram for GC analysis, we\u0026rsquo;re really talking about things. So 500 Dalton\u0026rsquo;s and you know, folks that are interested in these large proteins. They might say, I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything below 10,000 Daltons. ESI really gives us the ability to explore that world. And for ESI, we\u0026rsquo;re really talking about polar compounds. So we\u0026rsquo;re talking about that polar to very polar range, versus typical GCMs where we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with those nonpolar compounds. And you\u0026rsquo;ll notice I have another type of LCMS ionization there APCI. So if you\u0026rsquo;re from the environmental, or maybe even the forensic world, you might have heard of APCI and APCI, I like to describe as bridging the gap. So APCI allows us to look at some of the nonpolar as well as some of the polar compounds. So it can be good for some of those historically GC compounds. But it really allows us to kind of cover this full spectrum of polarity. So how does it work? On the left, we have an iron source. And on the right, we have just a little schematic of how that iron source is working. So you\u0026rsquo;ll notice in the image and the diagram, you see this capillary or this tube, surrounded by two heaters. So our LC is pumping, the solvent, the our analyte of interest and the lines of interest, all through this capillary. And that capillaries essentially making a spread. And one of the things that\u0026rsquo;s really important in LCMS analysis is that we have a good spread. So if we think about, you know, standing outside on a hot summer day with a hose, and we\u0026rsquo;re just to open a hose and hold it upside down, and just let the water pour out of it, we\u0026rsquo;d have a big puddle on our driveway. Versus least where I live in Colorado where we have 10% humidity, often, it\u0026rsquo;s super hot in the summer, if I were putting my thumb over that garden hose and create a really fine spray, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t run into the same issue. So we really want to make sure we\u0026rsquo;re having a consistent, conical spread. So we are spraying around and we\u0026rsquo;re applying a charge, the charge will apply here we\u0026rsquo;ll just talk about positive ionization. So we\u0026rsquo;re applying that positive charge to our analytes of interest. And we\u0026rsquo;re doing some evaporation to try to separate our solvent molecules. So if we think about that spray, right, we have these big droplets, and the droplet contains our analyte of interest things, we\u0026rsquo;re not interested in things that didn\u0026rsquo;t pick up a charge, our mobile phase, and we really want to separate that because we\u0026rsquo;re only interested in our ions of interest. So we want to pull those ions of interest through our mass spectrometer that way they be introduced, and we can do some experimenting with them. So all electrospray ionization is doing is helping us get that ion in a charge state. So we can now pull it through our mass spec. But there\u0026rsquo;s some important things to consider. Particularly with ESI, we really want to think about our charge state. For some of these larger compounds, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that those end up in different charge states, so you may end up with a charge state of 10, for example. And then we also want to think about the ability of the bedspread move through our mass spectrometer, some of the things that we\u0026rsquo;ll consider during the method development stage would be what ionization type to use. So right now for all my examples will be in positive mode, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make a difference in terms of theory. But when we get into the method development section, that\u0026rsquo;s where you might decide, hey, negative ionization is really how I\u0026rsquo;m going to get this compound to move through my mass spec. So just a quick example of a compound of interest, this compound has a mass of 146. If we\u0026rsquo;re doing a positive ionization, here, we would see a mask of 147. So we\u0026rsquo;re adding a plus one in this case, versus if we had a doubly charged on we\u0026rsquo;d see this divided by two. So instead of seeing a 147, or 148, because it\u0026rsquo;s two of the hydrogens, we\u0026rsquo;d see a 74. So when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with some of these larger molecules, things like proteins and polymers, understanding charge dates really crucial, because you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to know what maths to look for. But now that we\u0026rsquo;ve introduced our airlines, we can really get into the mass spec portion. So this is where we get to do the real mass spec mass spec. And at first, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be talking about quadruples. So quadruples were invented in the 50s by two German physicists. And we\u0026rsquo;ve been using them ever since because they\u0026rsquo;re really good at being maths filters. And the way they work without going into too much of the physics or too much detail is that we have four poles, right? So it has quad. And these poles have different voltages, so they have different RF and DC voltages. And we\u0026rsquo;re constantly changing those voltages and alternating them, so they have to a poles and two people\u0026rsquo;s, but our whole purpose in doing so is to keep the ion that you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, Let\u0026rsquo;s hypothetically say you really care about a mass of 500. So you want any ion with a mass of 500 or M over z within 500 to move through that quadrupole so what the The software and mass spec is essentially doing is applying voltages to do that. So you filter out those other ions that you\u0026rsquo;re not interested in. And really only retain that one interest or that one mass that you care about. So if we look at a little schematic of how that\u0026rsquo;s working, so here we have our positive ions, they\u0026rsquo;re moving through our triple quad. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got our Q1 agonist, the first mass filter, so these are all ionized using ESI, they\u0026rsquo;re being pulled through our first quadrupole. If we told the quadrupole to focus and filter out anything that\u0026rsquo;s not 500 M over z, everything else will fall out, and then it\u0026rsquo;ll be introduced into Q2, Q2, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear people refer to as collusion, so or Q2, and they\u0026rsquo;re both the same thing, you can use those terms interchangeably, it\u0026rsquo;s really just referring to where sort of that fragmentation happens. So instead of starting to use this quadrupole, as a filter, here, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be applying some energy to create something. And in our third quadrupole, that\u0026rsquo;s where we\u0026rsquo;re going to return to using that quadrupole as a mass filter. So if we take a second just to think about that selectivity, we have sort of a first mass or doing an experiment for a second or two that mass and then we\u0026rsquo;re filtering it again.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where we kind of get into some of this, this fun. So just a little brief about the background. But let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the questions that we can answer, because that\u0026rsquo;s the most exciting part about mass spectrometry, at least to me, are the questions that we can answer using it. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got our hands, let\u0026rsquo;s do our first workflow, maybe we want to do just some traditional quantification. So regardless of whether you have a triple quad, or acute trap, this experiment is going to work the exact same, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t notice that you used a cue track over a triple quad unless you happen to look in the metadata or peeked over at your instrument and saw that there was a badge on it. That\u0026rsquo;s a cue trap. So what is it what is an MRM experiment? So MRM, multiple reaction monitoring, sometimes people just refer to it as MSMS. Here we are taking a parent or a precursor. And we\u0026rsquo;re selecting that or focusing on that parent precursor and filtering out everything else. You\u0026rsquo;ll often hear people refer to it as a parent, precursor, interchangeable parent is a little bit of an older term, typically, in literature, you see it referred to as precursor now. But they both mean the same thing. So we focus on some parent, and then we\u0026rsquo;re doing some fragmentation. So that\u0026rsquo;s all taking place in that second quadrupole, where we\u0026rsquo;re creating something. So we\u0026rsquo;re we\u0026rsquo;re using energy to essentially like to say bust that compound apart into fragments, and a fragment, or a daughter ion is what\u0026rsquo;s produced. And then in our third quadrupole, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be filtering for a specific fragment, or daughter. And again, daughter and fragment, you can use interchangeably daughter is just a little bit of a more an older term. So what does that experiment actually look like? So here we have our quadruples. We\u0026rsquo;ve got Q1 Q2, q3. So in this experiment, I\u0026rsquo;m only interested in that compound with an M over z of 215. So I\u0026rsquo;m gonna use my first quadrupole to filter out everything else and only allow my chief 15 into my collision. So in my collision, cell, fragmentation is going to take place, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to fragment. So here I\u0026rsquo;ve got four fragments I could choose from. And again, in our next session, we\u0026rsquo;ll really talk about how to choose these fragments and how to optimize for these fragments. But in this case, I\u0026rsquo;m going to select my 185. So using my IQ three, I\u0026rsquo;m going to only allow that 185 to reach my detector, well then get my intensity, and then I can decide to use that for my planification. Right. So that sounds great. But maybe it seems like a little bit of overkill to you, why not just use the first RM that to 15. Surely that should be selective enough. And in some cases, it might be, but in a lot of cases it\u0026rsquo;s not. And I\u0026rsquo;ve got an example here from some data I worked on with the customer. So this is actually in LG protein. Powder is pretty delicious. I didn\u0026rsquo;t taste it. But they were looking for pesticides in this algae protein. And they were looking at specifically for MGK 264, which is a pesticide that two isomers of this pesticide. So if we look at the green box, we see those two beautiful isomers everything looks great. But if we go on over to the matrix blank, so this is just the straight algae powder, with nothing in it. We see almost two peaks that look exactly alike are pesticides isomers, they are at different retention times slightly. But if I was an analyst in a lab, I would have a really hard time being confident that that wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually mgkg, six, four. It was, especially with those two isomer peaks. And because of the sample, we knew it was a clean sample. So we went ahead and spiked it, and we saw our pesticides appear. But again, going back to our LC section, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have the chromatographic resolution to separate them from that interference. So we ended up with this kind of odd backwards L integration, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m not super confident, I know that value isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be very accurate, that don\u0026rsquo;t have my nice Gaussian curve. I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel good about this dataset when I\u0026rsquo;m just using my MS data. So we looked at her MRM experiment. And what we see is completely different. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got our standard again. But then in our matrix, we don\u0026rsquo;t see anything. So that\u0026rsquo;s telling us that just using the MS experiment, we saw those interferences, right. So those interferences had the same parent maths as the compound we were interested in. So likely, they had a very similar formula. But they weren\u0026rsquo;t that compound. So the structure was different. Although the formula and parent maths were likely fairly similar. But using our MRM data, we can see oh, well, the fragment in form, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing there. And we get these two beautiful pesticide peaks in our spike sample that we can then integrate and feel really good about in terms of quantification. So the benefits are a mirror data, it\u0026rsquo;s really about the selectivity, like we showed sensitivity. And it\u0026rsquo;s a fast experiment. So, you know, I talked about having the chromatographic resolution, which is really important. You saw that with the matrix interference, but because these experiments and MRM experiment is so selective, it\u0026rsquo;s okay if you have overlapping peaks, because they\u0026rsquo;re looking for two completely different things. So that allows you to have these really large panels. So here\u0026rsquo;s an example of I\u0026rsquo;d say, a medium, maybe small medium panel of 81 compounds, go medium. And you can see that we have some big superimposed, but they\u0026rsquo;re looking at completely different experiments. So we\u0026rsquo;re not worried about it. And in terms of how long these experiments take, typically, the low end, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about around 10 milliseconds for dwell time. But, you know, obviously, we\u0026rsquo;d like a little bit more. So if you can keep it around 50, you\u0026rsquo;re usually in really great shape. But if we think about how many experiments you can do in a second of each one takes 50 milliseconds, right? It\u0026rsquo;s a lot. But what are some of the other questions you can answer with an MSMS experiment. So these experiments are going to be unique to Q traps, just as a heads up. So the only difference really between a T trap and a triple quadrupole is that Q three region. So cue trap, right quadrupole trap. Everything up until that q3 is exactly the same, operated in the same way. And then we have this trap. I like to conceptually think about it. I grew up lobster fishing, my grandpa was a lobster fisherman. So I spent a lot of time doing that. So conceptually, when I was introduced to the traps, that\u0026rsquo;s just how I envisioned it. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure that would break some r\u0026amp;d Scientists hearts. But that kind of works the same thing in terms of just explaining, we\u0026rsquo;re really trapping the things we care about in that trap and letting the other things that we don\u0026rsquo;t care about the vetra. And instead of doing it with nets and ramps for doing it with voltages. So what we can do is we can do some really cool experiments that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do in just a traditional logical setting. So one of the experiments would be when we need to be highly selective. So how could you be more selective than an MRM experiment? Well, we can do M or M cubed. And just like it sounds, we\u0026rsquo;re taking a parent, we\u0026rsquo;re going to a daughter, then we\u0026rsquo;re going to a granddaughter, or we\u0026rsquo;re taking a precursor we\u0026rsquo;re going to a fragment, and we\u0026rsquo;re then we\u0026rsquo;re fragmenting it to another fragment. So we\u0026rsquo;re being very, very hyper specific to a specific compound structure. But what does that experiment look like? So here, we\u0026rsquo;re going to do the same thing. We\u0026rsquo;re focused on that 215. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to select that mass of 215 and pass it through a quadruple. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to do our fragmentation in Q2. But this is where it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit Different, here\u0026rsquo;s where we start to use that trapping function. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to select an ion of interest again that 185. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to trap it in our trap. Once we\u0026rsquo;ve isolated it, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go ahead and fragmented even further. So now we have the creation of these granddaughter islands. And from there, we can focus on a specific ion. So in this case, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at the 133. So what type of what type of scenario with this selectivity even be needed? Because maybe it seems like a little overkill right now. And there are two that I can think of that I use all the time. One would be in cannabis. Again, cannabis is a truly horrible matrix from an analytical standpoint. And the other would be looking at THC and hair. Another one of my least favorite matrices, it\u0026rsquo;s complicated. And it kind of just grosses me out, to be honest. But cannabis is just, it\u0026rsquo;s a tough plant matrix, we have high concentrations of cannabinoids, we have all these plant metabolites, it can be really challenging to look for pesticides in this matrix. So here we have an example of cycling through. So this is a pesticide that contains four isomers. So that\u0026rsquo;s why you see those peaks. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s going to depend a little bit on your chromatic graphic resolution, whether you see all four, or if you just see three. But we need to see this compound in cannabis at 10 parts per billion. And up top, we have a matrix blank, which has an interference that looks a lot like so from within. And down below, we have a spike to 10 DB V sample. So we can see Yeah, you know, obviously the intensity has increased. But I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not confident that that is truly Saifullah. So if we use a MRM cubed experiment, all of a sudden, we start to see Oh, and our matrix blank, we don\u0026rsquo;t see that interference. So that\u0026rsquo;s telling us, Hey, by being even more selective fees, whatever compound had this interference or looks like sci fi through and the structure was a little different. That fragment was a little different. So we didn\u0026rsquo;t have the exact same fragment. So when we fragmented that fragment, we ended up with a different result. And that\u0026rsquo;s why we have this clean matrix blank. But in our spikes sample, we all of a sudden see this nice peak. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re really looking for. And that\u0026rsquo;s where EMRAM cubed can be really valuable. But what if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to just do quantitation? What if you want to do qualitative studies and quantitative studies kind of at the same time, and I have a bias, this is my personal favorite workflow to keep track when we do some multitargeted security. So here, we\u0026rsquo;re going to do an MRM experiment, just like before, except we\u0026rsquo;re going to follow it up with an epi experiment. And it\u0026rsquo;s called an enhanced product ion experiment. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to be looking at fragmentation, and we\u0026rsquo;re essentially after the compounds fingerprint. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to get after. What does this look like? So for an MRM epi experiment, we\u0026rsquo;ll start out with our MRM experiment. So here we have an Si Si. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got again, that extracted ion chromatogram with alert peaks, and we apply some sort of intensity threshold, and we\u0026rsquo;re looking for a compound that passes or surpasses that intensity threshold. If the compound doesn\u0026rsquo;t like that compound in the dark blue, we\u0026rsquo;ll just move on to our next MRM experiment and continue down the line. If it does meet that threshold, what we\u0026rsquo;ll end up doing is our epi experiment. So here\u0026rsquo;s where we\u0026rsquo;re going to create fragments and essentially read them out to get the compounds fingerprint. What does that look like in real life well in an animation, so again, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on that to 15. I am. So we\u0026rsquo;re filtering out everything else. We\u0026rsquo;re creating fragments and Q2. And here we\u0026rsquo;re going to do something a little different, instead of just using a single collision energy. So the voltage we use to create fragments, we\u0026rsquo;re going to actually use three collision energies. And the reason we\u0026rsquo;re doing this is to create a wide range of fragments. So we want as many unique fragments as we can get. So this is a nice way of dnn paths there, we\u0026rsquo;re going to allow those fragments to fill up the ion track, and then be read out by the software. And as those exit they\u0026rsquo;ll reach the detector and we\u0026rsquo;ll get there masses. And this will give us the compounds. I like to call it again fingerprint. So when would you ever need to do this. So this is another example of a sample a customer gave me this was a powder. It was a supplement powder from a certain type of grass. And again, they need to look at for pesticides. And what we saw in the grass sample, even in the blank was this compound that looks a lot like the next car. So it had a peak shape. That was great. It even had a Secondary MRM, that looked really close to make the iron ratio between the, the first MRM. And the second MRM. Very similar to the standard. The only clue that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t an oxy car, from our MRM experiment was simply that it had a different retention time. But again, not a hugely different retention time, it was about 12 seconds. So maybe my column was just getting a little old, or maybe there was something different about this injection that caused a little bit of an earlier retention time. Again, this 12 seconds would be a cause for concern, usually, we\u0026rsquo;d like to keep it a plus or minus six seconds. But still, you know me as an analyst, I\u0026rsquo;m not, I\u0026rsquo;m not overly confident that this isn\u0026rsquo;t phonexa car surely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to make a mistake and have this batch go out to consumers who then would consume what appears to be a large amount of this pesticide. So we did our epi experiment. And from our epi experiment, that\u0026rsquo;s where we realized, Okay, up top, we have a matrix blank. And then on the left or right hand side, sorry, we have a fragmentation pattern. So this is their compounds fingerprint. And if we look down below for phenoxy card, those fingerprints don\u0026rsquo;t match at all. So not only do we have the retention time difference, but we have completely different molecular fingerprints, I\u0026rsquo;m happy, I will go stand up, write a report, do anything, I\u0026rsquo;m 100% sure that whatever is in that matrix is not phenoxy car, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is exactly, I could go back and search some libraries and try to figure it out. But for the purposes of this customer, they just needed to know that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t phenoxy car. So although mass spectrometry kind of seems like it would be a pretty easy thing, at least in television, that a lot of steps to it. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about the steps in the upcoming sections. But this kind of just gives you an idea of what to expect. When we think about LCMS, we want to think about separation. So we\u0026rsquo;re always kind of focused on getting the separation chromatographic resolution for compounds of interest. But really the question we always want to ask ourselves is what question are we trying to get out of our data? Are we trying to be quantitative? What analyze are we interested in? That\u0026rsquo;s really going to affect everything we do in the method development section, and everything we do and how we process the data. So with that, I want to thank you very much. And I can take any questions.\nQ\u0026amp;A #  Thank you so much, Karl, for the insightful presentation. And thank you for participating, and I hope you really enjoyed the content. And I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go ahead and start with the first one, Karl, which is around mobile phases, you mentioned that you sometimes include additives, specifically acids. And why do you include the additives? And if you are going to include an additive? How do you select which additive is best for your application? Yeah, absolutely. So great question. And actually, I have a couple of slides in our next presentation on this topic, specifically. So I encourage you just to check that out. But why are we adding additives at all. So we\u0026rsquo;re adding additives essentially, to change the pH of our mobile phase. And in doing so we help ionization, there can also be a couple of different tricks that you can use that aren\u0026rsquo;t just changing the pH. So one of the things I like to do again, you know, five backwards environmental I did a lot with Polymer analysis. For polymers, the ammonium addict is way more tense than AR plus H or sodium added. So I always like to add ammonium for me, because that helps promote some ammonium adducts so I can actually see the compounds and I\u0026rsquo;m interested in at a higher level. Excellent. Your comment on edX really drags into the next question. So if you\u0026rsquo;re having a problem with sodium ADOX, how can you reduce X How can you reduce particularly sodium, edX and MAs? Would new glass bottles help? Or is there cleaning techniques that should be utilized in order to reject reduce addict formation? Yeah, sodium, sodium adducts can be tricky to get rid of right and you hit the nail on the head with the glass. So it could be coming from your class. Another thing I would encourage you to try is try to experiment with a different source from your your mobile phase that you\u0026rsquo;re using for your aqueous so for example, if you\u0026rsquo;re using like an in house DI water, maybe try if you have milli Q or you know Goldstar would be to go and get some HPLC grade ms grade water from somewhere like maybe Fischer or sigma and give that a try and see if that can reduce some of this automatics using excellent it. The next question is around pressure. You talked about the pressure traces specifically for mobile phase A and for mobile phase B being seen? And can you comment on what you might anticipate as you increase your organic composition? What pressure change might be expected? And is that variable between types of organic mobile phases? Like if you\u0026rsquo;re using a pseudo nitrile versus methanol? Yeah, great question. I saw that question in the chat. And it makes sense. You\u0026rsquo;re, you\u0026rsquo;re absolutely right, right. Your pressure would be less with something like an acetal Nitro, methanol. But the way I was showing it was just the pressure read back from that one pump. So the way I had that pump set up was there, two binary pumps, so each has their own pressure. So that\u0026rsquo;s why you see this increasing amount of pressure from pump be even though maybe your total pressure is going down. So hopefully that kind of answers your question. Great. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re moving on to some mass spectrometry questions from some chromatography based questions. What if you don\u0026rsquo;t know the parent ion that you would like to generate an MRM type of analysis on? What strategies should you use in order to determine and can you create an experiment, a mass spectrometry based experiment without knowing the precursor mass or pairing on before? Yeah, good question. And again, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over that for sure. In the method development section, but there are a couple of approaches you can take. And it really depends on the question you\u0026rsquo;re trying to answer. So if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to quantify something, presumably you have a standard for that. So the easiest thing to do would be to go ahead and infuse that standard. And then just do an experiment where you scan for sort of a predicted mass range. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about in the next session, how to how to define that predictive mass range. But a simple example would be if you know, your standard has a mass of 500, you would set your first quadrupole, to look for from 495 to 525, to make sure you account for semantics, and also you see as many forms of that compound as possible. That being said, on the other hand, if your question was more into the, I have this unknown sample, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I want to look for, with a cue trap, you could do some unknown screening, where you\u0026rsquo;re essentially kind of doing the same thing that I was talking about with your MRM experiment, except you\u0026rsquo;re using the trap to enhance some of the ions around and then using that intensity threshold just like before to do your MSMS experiment, and it will do that based on whatever feature it sees. That\u0026rsquo;s above that threshold. Excellent. And next similar question around choosing the best precursor ion. What if you have a probative molecule and a couple of attic formations? How do you select which particular ion you should use as your precursor ion? Yeah, again, I\u0026rsquo;m excited because this means that the next session is going to be really good. So the way I do this, is I choose them all. And I choose them all initially until I get into a matrix. And I think what you\u0026rsquo;ll find is that different parents may have different interferences that you don\u0026rsquo;t experience with, say an Imodium addict. You see it with a plus h or sodium. So until I\u0026rsquo;ve run my sort of spikes sample in my desired matrix, I keep them all there and then choose the best one afterwards, based on intensity, usually your signal to noise. Excellent. The next question is around the fragmentation. You may get multiple fragments from a precursor ion, how do you choose what out of the different fragments that you get you want to take on to use in your final methodology? Yeah, and it goes to the same point, I would choose them all? Well, within reason, right? If there\u0026rsquo;s 15, probably not 15, but choose at least the top five. And if you\u0026rsquo;re working with a particularly challenging matrix, maybe something like serum or some sort of environmental matrix or blood, choosing them all and then spiking them into the matrix that you want to actually analyze is typically the best way I\u0026rsquo;ve found and then using that signal for noise to decide which which are in gives you the best sensitivity. Excellent. I can tell everybody who\u0026rsquo;s joining us today is really going to benefit from the next session as well. So I really am excited for you guys to sign up and join that. The next question is around chromatographic resolution and what is sufficient or appropriate chromatographic resolution and chromatographic separation for when you\u0026rsquo;re utilizing MSMS and how do you balance those two? Really good question. And it\u0026rsquo;s definitely something that it\u0026rsquo;s gonna depend a little bit. And I know that\u0026rsquo;s a tough answer to hear. But it\u0026rsquo;s going to depend on what you\u0026rsquo;re kind of experiencing. So typically, if you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with sort of trace level compounds, having your MRM superimposed, isn\u0026rsquo;t really going to make a huge difference. But if you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with compounds that are in high abundance, what you can have is some suppression occurring. So because you have two compounds at high abundance coming out at the same time, you can only i\u0026amp;i So many things at once. And you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that you\u0026rsquo;ll have some source suppression. So we see it all the time with pee fast analysis. Once the concentrations get too high, we have some suppression. So we have to make sure our chromatogram is spread out sufficiently that we don\u0026rsquo;t experience it. But when I do my trace pesticide analysis, that\u0026rsquo;s no longer a problem. So I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s gonna depend a little bit on the levels you\u0026rsquo;re after. Excellent. We have a question around the epi analysis, using the Q trap technology. How do you select the appropriate collision energy when you are utilizing an API, which looks at more than one fragment? Great question. So the default for sciences is 35 volts, which that usually works really well for most small molecules. But as you get into some of these higher molecules, things like or higher weight things, so maybe you\u0026rsquo;re doing some polymer analysis, 35 might really produce any fragments for you. So you might need to increase that. So typically, what I would do is start with 35. And then the for the three collision energies, you\u0026rsquo;d be plus 15, minus 15. Usually what I do, and simply because that matches the library that I use, which is the science library, but if you\u0026rsquo;re looking interested in some of these larger molecules, it might be worth playing around with collision energy and increasing them. So usually, as you deal with larger and larger molecules, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to increase the collision energy as those molecules get larger. Great. The next question is around matrix effects. How does how does different matrix and different matrices impact and production and inefficiency? Yes, the answer is a lot. And this is where we\u0026rsquo;ll have to rely on a few different mass spec tricks, and then a few different chromatographic tricks to help to deal with those issues. So like the previous question was asking about chromatographic resolution. That\u0026rsquo;s one way to deal with nasty matrix. So separating out some of these interferences and one approach. From a mass spec standpoint, we didn\u0026rsquo;t talk about it today. But there\u0026rsquo;s a variable called declustering potential, which should be specific to your parent molecule that you can adjust to try to remove some of the things you\u0026rsquo;re not interested in and keep the eye on that you truly are interested in. In terms of keeping the sensitivity as high as possible. And the last thing I would kind of encourage is, those M RMS likely you\u0026rsquo;ll see different suppression on different M RMS. So you might want to go ahead and just try even though it might not be the most intense MRM you might experience less suppression on emiram. Last question we have time for today, Karl is around epi methodologies. I have a question on is all the different shoe trap instruments available? Do they all offer epi analysis capabilities? Yep. Yep. Yeah. So if you have a Q trap, you have that functionality. Again, I want to thank you, Karl, for the insightful presentation. I want to thank all of you for spending the last hour with us. We really hope it was informative and insightful for you as you grow your mass spec expertise and knowledge. So again, stay safe, stay healthy. Thanks for joining us, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see you soon. Bye for now.\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Sciex-Courses/02_Method_development/","title":"02 Method Development","section":"Sciex LC-MS/MS 101","content":" Video: 02 Method Development\nStep 1: Compound optimization\n Q1 scan (identify the parent) Product ion scan (identify the fragments) MRM scans (optimize your parameters)  Step 2: Chromatography\n Choosing a column Selecting a mobile phase Using chromatography  Step 3: sMRM method\n Run a mid or high level standard Create a method in analytics and process a sample Copy and paste RT into your method  Hello, and welcome to the second session of LC-MS/MS 101 method development. Today we\u0026rsquo;re going to focus on strategies and techniques for method development for mass spectrometry assays. I\u0026rsquo;m Crystal halt, and I\u0026rsquo;m your moderator for today. Today I\u0026rsquo;m joined with our speaker Dr. Karl Oetjen. Dr. Karl Oetjen, is a senior scientist driving food, environmental forensics, clinical and cannabis applications at science. Before joining science, he completed his PhD at Colorado School of Mines, where his research focused on non targeted characterization of complex surfactant mixtures, including aqueous film forming foams, which led to the discovery of several novel per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, also known as PFS, that since it\u0026rsquo;s been found in a variety of environmental samples, and industrial chemicals. Since joining sciex, Karl has worked with numerous labs, creating and implementing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Take it away, Karl.\nThank you so much, crystal. So if you\u0026rsquo;re new, or just joining us today, welcome. If you\u0026rsquo;re returning, that\u0026rsquo;s awesome. Glad to have you here. And we\u0026rsquo;re gonna be talking about method development. So method development is really the time that we get to be a little bit creative as analytical chemists. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to cover the approach to making a new quantitation method. So this would be for a new assay, just from scratch. But also the same steps could be used to add a compound to an existing assay, just something we get asked a lot to do.\nStep 1: Compound optimization #  So up first, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about compound optimization. So this is going to be our sort of first thing we need to do, we need to define what our compounds are, we need to choose what compounds we want to look for. And then we need to optimize for those parameters. So the method we\u0026rsquo;ll be building today will be a quantitative method. So this will be a standard MRM method.\nSo up first, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go ahead and identify a product or do that Q1 scan. So if you remember from the previous session, when we were talking about parents, the parent is what we\u0026rsquo;re interested in. So that say, if we are interested in Reserpine that is what we\u0026rsquo;re going to be looking for. So we first need to identify it. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to do a Q1 scan, which is going to scan an area and we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk a little bit about how to set that up.\nNext, we\u0026rsquo;re going to define the fragments. So we talked a lot last time about fragmentation, fragmentation methods. So those fragments are sort of like the compounds fingerprints. And in MRM experiment, if you remember, we\u0026rsquo;re going from a parent to a daughter or a precursor to a fragment. So we really need to first define what fragments exist for that compound.\nAnd last, and probably most important, we need to optimize parameters for the specific fragments.\nSlide #  [3:17] So let\u0026rsquo;s get started. So the first thing we need to decide is what ionization technique we\u0026rsquo;re going to use. So LCMS, right, we\u0026rsquo;re mostly talking about electrospray ionization, that\u0026rsquo;s the probably the most commonly used ionization technique. But within ESI, there\u0026rsquo;s positive and there\u0026rsquo;s negative. There\u0026rsquo;s also APCI. So if you are dealing with compounds that are a little nonpolar, maybe sort of with that GC realm, maybe APCI will be a good choice, we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk a lot about ESI. And pretty much exclusively, but I like to use this example, as a time when Hey, APCI was actually a better choice. So for this compound, Irganox 1076, I went ahead and ran it four times the same instrument with the same column, the same standard, and I just changed the ionization techniques. So I went from an ESI negative mode to an API and negative mode. did subsequently in positive mode, as well. And what you see is you get this really nice giant peak for APCI negative. This kind of makes sense for this compound. It\u0026rsquo;s got a really long alkyl tail. But for ESI, you get a much smaller signal and for use that positive sentiment shown because there really wasn\u0026rsquo;t a signal. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to take some time to sort of consider the analysts were interested in. So what are their size? How polar are they? Were they traditionally done by GCMS? Before we kind of move into our ionization approaches, but for the majority of the time, if not more than 95% of the time, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be dealing in the ESI realm.\nSlide #  So what\u0026rsquo;s the difference between positive and negative, and just put very simply, the difference between positive and negative would be in positive mode, we\u0026rsquo;re really adding something. So here we\u0026rsquo;ll be adding maybe an ammonium, or a sodium. And we call these things adducts, or a +H would be the common was common adduct that you\u0026rsquo;d observe. So in positive mode, we\u0026rsquo;re adding something to our compound. So even if your your compound has been true mass of, let\u0026rsquo;s say, 100, if we add a +H, the observed mass would be 101. Right? Because we\u0026rsquo;re adding something that compared to negative mode, where we\u0026rsquo;re, we\u0026rsquo;re taking something away. So in negative mode, we would be, for example, removing hydrogen, so we\u0026rsquo;d see a -1. So if that same compound had a mass of 100, our observed mass would be 99. And that\u0026rsquo;s really why we have to do this Q1 scan, you need to observe what the mass we want to isolate for MRM experiment. And we have to identify what that mass is.\nSlide #  So for this example, I have a polyethylene glycol, and I\u0026rsquo;m showing you this because we have the +H and the +NH4 adducts shown. So this would be just our simple Q1 skin, I knew the mass of this polyethylene glycol, and I just scanned from a range of 414, up to somewhere around 440. And what I see is kind of interesting. If I were to just go ahead and assume that my +H was the most abundant addict, I\u0026rsquo;d really miss out on this big NH4 peak. So that p+NH4, which has a lot more sensitivity, or a lot more intensity than this +H. So that\u0026rsquo;s where sort of doing these definitions of what I\u0026rsquo;m actually looking for become really important. So with positive mode, which is what we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about, primarily, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about negative mode a little bit, you\u0026rsquo;ll commonly see +H, +NH4 +Na, so we want to keep our eyes peeled for those +1, +17, +23, of our parent compound versus in negative mode, where most of the time we\u0026rsquo;re just looking at a deprotonated compound.\nSlide #  So just as a little bit of a reminder, from last session, we\u0026rsquo;re building our MRM method. So the first thing we need to do is identify our parent. In this case, we have a parent of 215. So our quadrupole is going to filter out everything that\u0026rsquo;s not 215, we then need to go ahead and create some fragmentation. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to do that in Q2 where the collusion cell. So fragmentation is going to take place. And that will be our next step, we need to define those fragments, what are those masses that that compound fragments into. And then finally, our Q3 will be used as a filter, again, to filter out a specific item in this example would be that 185. So that\u0026rsquo;s great. That\u0026rsquo;s a nice little animation of you know, what\u0026rsquo;s happening, but what are the parameters we\u0026rsquo;re really after.\nSlide: Optimize three major parameters #  And we\u0026rsquo;re really after these three major parameters,\nthe declustering potential (DP). So if you remember, that\u0026rsquo;s the ability to, or the energy used to minimize soften clusters. So that\u0026rsquo;s really going to depend on the parent mass, or the parent compound, rather,\nthe collision energy (CE). So that\u0026rsquo;s that energy we\u0026rsquo;re using to create fragmentation, and then\nthe collision exit cell potential (CXP). So that would be the energy used to transmit ions through Q3.\nSo these are the three things that we\u0026rsquo;re going to optimize for each one of those transitions.\nSlide #  But we first have to know what we\u0026rsquo;re looking for. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the example for Reserpine. Reserpine has a mass of 608. So this massive 608, great, we\u0026rsquo;re happy. What am I going to do? How do I how do I decide? Or how do I identify what to actually isolate or filter on Q1? So the experiment I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is called a just a Q1 scan. And essentially what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is instead of having that quadrupole fixated on a specific mass, we\u0026rsquo;re letting it scan and mass range. And typically I like to let that mass range be plus or Morocco plus in the case of positive mode 25 Dalton\u0026rsquo;s from whatever it may be true, massive my compound is and I\u0026rsquo;m doing that because I want to include all of those adducts, so I want to include that +H that ammonia adduct that put 17 and that sodium adduct that plus 23, says those are the more common adducts that I would observe. So when I do that for Reserpine, I see I get a really nice peek at my plus one. So we\u0026rsquo;ve protonated this we have 609 now. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to choose for my subsequent experiments, because it\u0026rsquo;s giving me the best density. So I\u0026rsquo;ve identified my parent.\nSlide #  And the next step is to really figure out what is it going to fragment into. So to do that, we\u0026rsquo;re doing a product scan. So we\u0026rsquo;re kind of moving our way down the quadruples, as I like to say. So we\u0026rsquo;ve decided what our Q1 is going to look for. Now we need to get Q2 involved, and we got to create some fragments. So product ion scan, we\u0026rsquo;re going to filter for just that 609, determined that\u0026rsquo;s the best. Best to filter out, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be the best sensitivity. Now we got to figure out what fragments this was Reserpine make. So we are going to essentially have our Q3 scan from up 50 daltons, since that\u0026rsquo;s a nice lower limit for a particle up to plus one of our parent mass. So we determined that our observed Mazda 609, so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna have Q3 stuff at 610, just because I like to see that parent mess in my MSMS spectrum. And it\u0026rsquo;s just gonna scan that range, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to read all the fragments. So as we ramp our collision energy, we see fragmentation. So we typically will ramp collision energy, right, because we don\u0026rsquo;t know what an optimal collision energy is, for any of these fragments. We haven\u0026rsquo;t done that experiment. So instead, we\u0026rsquo;re going to ramp it. And we\u0026rsquo;re just going to observe what happens. And what I like to do is pick the top five fragments, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of overkill, someone say, but usually, if you choose five, you\u0026rsquo;re in a pretty good place in case one of them has a matrix interference, as you kind of move down in your method development stage. So it gives you a little bit of wiggle room, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have five fragments, which happens all the time. For example, in the case of fluorochemicals, typically, we only have one maybe two fragments take which can get. And then over five is usually a little bit of a little bit of overkill. But everything we do from this point on is it going to take any more time, if we do it with five fragments, or if we do it with two fragments. So having an extra just gives you a little bit of flexibility in the long run.\nSlide: Optimize the declustering potential (DP) #  So we\u0026rsquo;ve picked our fragments, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to do our MRM experiment. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to optimize for those parameters we talked about earlier. So the first one would be the declustering potential. So the declustering potential right, is the voltage to minimize the solvent clusters. So it\u0026rsquo;s before any fragmentation is occurring. It\u0026rsquo;s right at our source, it\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s kind of I like to say pulling our compound in. So because of that all of our MRM transitions shown here should look the same. In the sense, the profile should look the same. So we have those five fragmented shows that 397, the 195. And we have their profiles, and we sort of see this decrease by by a little bit of an increase in this sort of level areaish, before it decreases again. And that\u0026rsquo;s great, too, is dependent on the parent, all of these should look exactly the same. So if I was going to choose an optimal DP value, choose something in this range, probably around 150ish would be a great value for Reserpine. But why did I bother doing this with all of those fragments, if it\u0026rsquo;s going to be the same? And as based on the parent? What\u0026rsquo;s the point?\nSlide #  And the reason I like to do this kind of a personal preference, but I like to use it as a little bit of a forensic tool. So because we\u0026rsquo;re looking at fragments of a parent, and that parent should react the same way to declustering potential every time, if we see a different profile like the one shown here in pink, I can go ahead and say, Hey, turns out, maybe maybe I chose a fragment that was really in the mud was very low in intensity, or maybe I have some background ion that\u0026rsquo;s also has an 609 is giving me sort of this interference, or false peak. And I choose that as one of my fragments I can use to declustering potential as sort of a sanity check to make sure, hey, that profile and pink is very different than the one I saw in blue. And because of that, I can go ahead and say no, that\u0026rsquo;s not Reserpine. So I\u0026rsquo;m not even going to consider it, I\u0026rsquo;m going to remove it. Or maybe this would be a good time for me to go back and, and refuses to serve you and say, Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m confident this is Reserpine right. So it can be a little bit of a, a tool that you can use to make it so you don\u0026rsquo;t make any mistakes in the long run. Save yourself a little bit of time. So we\u0026rsquo;ve written down our declustering potential, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be the same for all of our fragments,\nSlide: Optimize the collision energy #  we chose 150 Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to go ahead and ramp that collision energy. So when we ramp the collision energy, we\u0026rsquo;re going to ramp it for each one of the MRM transitions are each one of those fragments. Each of them are an experiment individually, and typically will ramp it somewhere from five volts up to 150 And when we do that, what you usually see is that things with smaller fragments require a little bit higher collusion energy, it\u0026rsquo;s not always true, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good rule of thumb. So as you increase the collision energy, you\u0026rsquo;ll start to see smaller and smaller fragments. So I\u0026rsquo;ve done that here, each one of these represents my five fragments I chose in the earlier slide, I can go ahead and choose my ideal collision energy. So for that 195 would be about 50, compared to that 174, which may be the 60 range. And I\u0026rsquo;d go ahead and transfer all these values to a notebook or Excel or however right into my method, however, you\u0026rsquo;re sort of keeping your notes.\nSlide: Optimize the collision cell exit potential (CXP) #  And finally, last but not least, our collision cell exit potential. So this is remember that value that we need for Q3. And the one thing about this is if we consider all the intensity that you could gain in terms of compound optimization, collision energy and declustering potential are going to account for 95%ish of the intensity on the table, compared to CXP, which is pretty small amount. Typically, if you\u0026rsquo;re choosing a value within the default range 10 to 15, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be almost at an optimal value right from the start. And in that case, that\u0026rsquo;s what we see here. So somewhere between that 10 - 15, maybe a value of 12 would be the optimal sort of point to give us the most sensitivity. So what I like to tell folks, when they\u0026rsquo;re when they\u0026rsquo;re doing combat optimization, is if you need that little bit of intensity, to get to your limit of quantitation, or limited detection, 60 can help if you\u0026rsquo;re talking about a few percent. But if you need more than that, going after something like collision energy to declustering potential, or some other way to gain that sensitivity is going to be a little bit more fruitful for you.\nSlide: SCIEX OS Software guided MRM optimization #  And all of this, of course, can be done automatically. So in most software\u0026rsquo;s like SCIEX OS, we have an automatic script, that\u0026rsquo;s going to go ahead and just go through this process for you. That\u0026rsquo;s great, especially if you have a lot of compounds. So you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do it manually, which can be a little bit tedious. The reason I kind of bring this up is even if you are choosing an automatic workflow, which again, great, you just want to be a little bit awary, since we are using something like a syringe pump to actually introduce the compound into our mass spec. Every once in a while I\u0026rsquo;m guilty of it. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave a bubble behind in my syringe, and I\u0026rsquo;ll get a spike in intensity. And that can be a little bit confusing sometimes for software\u0026rsquo;s. Because they might think, hey, that spike is actually the most intense point really, it\u0026rsquo;s just an artifact for me not doing a good job in bubbles on my syringe. So if you do choose one of these automated approaches, just go ahead and give it a glance over make sure you\u0026rsquo;re still paying attention and using some of the rules we talked about to decide if this data is good data.\nStep 2: Chromatography #  So we set up our compound optimization, our next topic we need to cover is chromatography. So this is really important. So unlike before, we now have our LC in the mix, so we\u0026rsquo;re no longer just infusing from a syringe. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got a sample that contains our standard. And we\u0026rsquo;re gonna go ahead and inject it onto our mass spec. And when we do this, our goal here is to go ahead and choose a column, we need to choose a mobile phase which includes a modifier. And then we need to use that chromatography and when I say use that chromatography, I mean, optimize it. So go ahead and move interferences or separate our interferences from our ions of interest, get our ideal duration, etc.\nSlide: Choosing a column #  So how much of a difference does a column make? So in this example, I have Irganox 1135, which I ran on the same instrument with the same mobile phase, same sample, the only thing I changed was the column. And what we see I\u0026rsquo;ve got an F5, C8 and a C18. From F5, I had less intensity than my C8 and C18. And with my C8, I had the compound eluding a little bit earlier. And I also didn\u0026rsquo;t have some of that tailing that was occurring with the C18. So that\u0026rsquo;s great. Not a huge difference. You could kind of argue between the C8 and C18 to get a similar result. But when we look at a larger compound like Irganox 1076, so the difference here would be that much longer. alkane tail going from a C8 to C18. We see a big difference in retention time. So between that C8 and C18. There\u0026rsquo;s several minutes I could optimize my chromatography, sure. But I have a really nice peak for my C8. And this might be what you\u0026rsquo;re after, you might really want that much separation, maybe you have a bunch of polymers you\u0026rsquo;re looking at, and you really want them spread out. In my scenario, when I was doing this experiment, that\u0026rsquo;s not what I wanted. So I rolled out the F5, just because of that intensity, but I ended up choosing that C8, because it gave me enough separation between the ions I was interested in. And then I can kind of shorten up the method. When I use my chromatography, like we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about,\nSlide #  well, what are some of the common sort of starting and stationary phases that you can use? So when we talk about stationary phases, if you remember from the first section, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about selectivity, and selectivity is really going to impact our chromatic resolution. So kind of like what we saw in that earlier slide. Even the difference between a C8 and C18 led to a big difference in my retention time. So which stationary phase you choose is going to depend a little bit based on your goals, but also, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be heavily impacted by what compounds you\u0026rsquo;re interested in. So if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something like positional isomers, something like a by phenol, especially if it has a bunch of greens, can be really useful. Versus if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something a little bit more polar. And I should have said earlier, I\u0026rsquo;m really talking about reverse phase chromatography. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on. So I\u0026rsquo;m not really talking about HILIC very much. But if you have questions, feel free to ask. So we\u0026rsquo;re gonna be talking about the reverse phase. So if I have something polar, so my polar compounds earlier, right, something like Luna Omega Polar is a really nice option. This is a C18, but it will retain sort of things like diminish, add or activate some of these really small polar analytes, a little bit better than just a traditional C18. But if you\u0026rsquo;re just starting out, and you\u0026rsquo;re totally unsure, starting with sort of just the general C18 approach, it\u0026rsquo;s a really good starting point, you\u0026rsquo;re going to get an idea of what\u0026rsquo;s retaining what\u0026rsquo;s not retaining, you can even start to experiment with some mobile phases. And then if you need to go ahead and do some optimization on your stationary phase later, or you might say this is just acceptable.\nSlide: Column Length #  But beyond the stationary phase, what other variables can affect my chromatography, and one would be column length, right. So as our column gets longer, our pressure typically goes up, which can be totally fine, you\u0026rsquo;ll definitely want to make sure your system your LC system can handle that. So if you have just a standard HPLC, you want to make sure your pressure isn\u0026rsquo;t exorbitantly high as 12,000 psi or something like that, where you\u0026rsquo;re going to damage your instrument. But usually with column length, you\u0026rsquo;re not too worried about that, but more comes into play with particle size. That being said, if you\u0026rsquo;d feel that way, a couple of tricks that you can do to sort of reduce your pressure would be to turn up the column oven. So as you increase the temperature in your column up and your pressure should come down. The other option, obviously, would be to go ahead and reduce your flow rate. But what else this column might change. And the big variable would be the elution time. So this might be good or bad, depending on your goals. So if you are really concerned about speed, you want a really quick method, you need separation, but you want your method to be a few minutes long, something like a 50 millimeter column can be a really good choice. That being said, if you want optimal sort of resolution, choosing something a little bit longer, like 150 millimeter column can be a good choice. So if you have a really dirty matrix, having that resolution might be beneficial, because you have a bunch of plant metabolites in the sample that you need to separate from your pesticides or other metabolites.\nSlide: Column particle size #  And besides column length, particle size is the other sort of big contributor to our chromatographic resolution. So as your particle size decreases, our pressure is going to increase. So if you want to go with a really, really small particle size, you should expect to have fairly high pressures. So we call that ultra high pressure. So those are things like 10 12,000 psi versus your standard HPLC, which be operating in the 3000 psi range, typically. And what\u0026rsquo;s the benefit here? So the benefit is, as you make your particle size smaller, typically you make your peak widths, more narrow. So if you think of the same amount of area under your peak, but you\u0026rsquo;re making it more narrow, it\u0026rsquo;s coming up and up and up. So you\u0026rsquo;re increasing your intensity or you\u0026rsquo;re sort of making a bit taller separating it from its baseline, so you get a little boost in sensitivity. There\u0026rsquo;s obviously going to be trade offs here. One of which I have felt I\u0026rsquo;ve come to a future times, but I\u0026rsquo;ll give you one example of a story. So I went ahead and injected. Well, I got a very nice 1.3 micro meter column from the folks at Phenomenex. They sent it to me. And my goal was to look at some pesticides in this really nasty plant matrix, and have doing this on a 3.5 micrometer column for a while, and everything was going well, but I wanted a little increase in sensitivity. So I went ahead and conditioned my column, and injected my sample onto that column and destroyed that column. Completely destroyed, it was never used again, couldn\u0026rsquo;t use it. And that happened, because it had this really nasty matrix, right? It was acceptable to use that 3.5. So I had a little bit bigger particle size, but when I got to that really narrow, or tiny particle size, I ended up just clogging it pretty much instantly. So if you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with sort of these really nasty matrices, whether that be serum or hair, or plants, just make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about your sample prep when you\u0026rsquo;re choosing your column and your column particle size.\nSlide: Mobile phase #  So we\u0026rsquo;ve chosen a column, let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and say we chose middle of the road, we got to see your team 100 millimeters with a 2.6 particle size, micro particle size. So just straight middle of the road, the next thing we need to do is go ahead and choose our mobile phase. So when we talk about mobile phase, we have our mobile phase A rate that is aqueous, and our mobile phase B for that organic. And usually in LCMS, there\u0026rsquo;s not a whole lot of playing around we do with our mobile phase in the sense of it\u0026rsquo;s A is pretty much always water, B is usually methanol, or acetonitrile. most labs would prefer methanol because it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s quite a bit cheaper than acetonitrile. But sometimes acetonitrile gives you a little bit better resolution, where there is a little bit more flexibility would be in your buffers, or modifiers. So here, we have some examples of some common modifiers. In positive mode, I\u0026rsquo;d say formic acid is almost the most common modifier, and we\u0026rsquo;re heading modifiers to accomplish a few things.\nOne, is we want that pH control, right. And we want that pH to be stable, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to have shifts in pH that are going to cause resolution differences or illusion time differences. So we want that stability, and\nTwo, is we want that pH to be different than the pKa of the compounds we\u0026rsquo;re interested in right, as the pH and pKa. get very close. If that pKa is the same, right, we\u0026rsquo;re not really not going to be ionizing efficiently. So as we move that away, we ionize a little bit better. So typically, we will go into the two to three pH range for most compounds, and positive mode seems to work pretty well. One thing you\u0026rsquo;ll also notice here is all of these buffers are volatile. So we don\u0026rsquo;t want to use salts, things that maybe were acceptable with LCUV, like a phosphate buffer. Because we needed to qualify as we\u0026rsquo;re doing a different experiment, we need to have things enter the mass spec ionize where set up different and we\u0026rsquo;re looking at different things, we\u0026rsquo;re not doing UV analysis anymore. So something like a phosphate buffer would be just inappropriate. And if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure, almost always go ahead and just try a generic starting mobile phase first. So something like water with some formic acid, usually 0.1% is a really good starting value. And you can add it to your organic as well. So something like a 0.1 in your methanol, if you are interested in things like ammonia adducts. So for example, on this slide I showed earlier with that, you know, huge ammonia adduct peak, and is something like ammonium formate is going to help promote that adduct for me. So if you are looking at ammonium adduct, adding ammonium formate is going to be your best bet. And you\u0026rsquo;re gonna want to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re doing this regularly, right? These things are volatile. So as we let them sit, our mobile phase, essentially it gets called Old. But we\u0026rsquo;re just losing our our modifiers and buffers. So if you notice, for example, the sensitivity of certain ions decreasing over time, and you look up on your LC stack, and you see that you\u0026rsquo;ve been using the same mobile phase for a month now, it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good time to make a new batch.\nSlide: Gradient #  So we\u0026rsquo;ve chosen our mobile phase, we\u0026rsquo;re just going to go generic again. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to sort of use that chromatography and get the method to meet our standards and the things we need to accomplish. So we talked about this a little bit last time, so I won\u0026rsquo;t go too far into it. But we essentially have these four stages of chromatogram. We have a aqueous stage where we\u0026rsquo;re letting our more polar things elute, we have this ramp stage. And then we have our non negotiable final two stages, which be a stage where we clean off the column, or we hold at a very high organic. So typically, this is 95% or above our mobile phase B. And we want to hold there long enough to get ideally three column volumes worth of mobile phase through our column to really clean that out. And finally, our equilibration phase, which is also non negotiable, we need to get our starting conditions back at the exact same place they were when we did our first injection, so we don\u0026rsquo;t have shifts in our attention time. And here, we would just go ahead and hold for the same three column volumes. But how do we use this chromatography, because certainly, it\u0026rsquo;s not always going to look like a ramp up from 95%, sometimes we may be are holding for a little bit to let some separation between some isomers occur. Sometimes we might run super fast, or just have an isocratic method.\nSlide #  So what are we doing when we do that, and essentially, with reverse phase chromatography, as we increase the percent B, things are going to lead faster. So if we increase that ramping, or we increase that starting condition, so here I have the same compound, the only differences, I have a high starting condition, for my percent B versus a low starting condition on the bottom. And you\u0026rsquo;ll notice the retention time is very different. So about four minutes different. So this could be great if I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a really fast method for this specific compound. But if I have things are maybe super polar, and I started at a very high organic, it just won\u0026rsquo;t be retained by my column at all. And it will just kind of fly through the system, and it won\u0026rsquo;t have a nice peak. So there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a little bit of a balance. And that\u0026rsquo;s like that with everything with method development, right? We\u0026rsquo;re talking about building a customized method for your analysts. So it\u0026rsquo;s going to be very custom.\nSlide: sMRM methods #  [32:08] And finally, once we\u0026rsquo;ve kind of identified that, yes, this is, this is my chromatography, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with, I want to go ahead and move on to my final stage, the next thing I would encourage you to do is go ahead and schedule that method. So scheduling means that you\u0026rsquo;re essentially telling the software in your instrument, a time to look for that analyte. So you\u0026rsquo;re saying at two minutes is one analyte, in this case, four minutes at around four minutes is where I expect this analyte to show up. And it does great, why am I doing this, the reason I\u0026rsquo;m doing this is, because if I don\u0026rsquo;t schedule my method, and I have a ton of different analytes, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be looking for everything all the time. And if it\u0026rsquo;s looking for everything all the time, it can\u0026rsquo;t do as good of a job. Similar to me, if I\u0026rsquo;m multitasking, I can\u0026rsquo;t do as good a job. Whereas if I\u0026rsquo;m focused on one thing and a specific time, usually can do a little bit better. So you\u0026rsquo;ll see that in your data quality. So if you only have one or two main analytes, maybe a handful of analytes, it\u0026rsquo;s less important. But if you\u0026rsquo;re getting into the range of 20,30, 40, or you know, a few 100 analytes, that\u0026rsquo;s for scheduling really becomes not only important, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much mandatory. And the differences in the data quality can be seen here. So we have the pink, which was unscheduled, and the blue, which was scheduled. And what you\u0026rsquo;ll notice about the pink is that it\u0026rsquo;s essentially a triangle. So each one of those dots represents a data point where the instrument actually collected data. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got this triangle sort of shapes. And that triangle becomes really difficult to integrate, because it\u0026rsquo;s going to change a lot depending on where that apex is. So it\u0026rsquo;s going to change depending on where the instrument was what it was looking for, at that time, compared to our peak in the blue, where we have this nice sort of Gaussian peak with plenty of points across it. So if there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit difference in where those points are, it\u0026rsquo;s not really going to change the area underneath my peak as much as it would if I was just integrating the triangle. So typically, we\u0026rsquo;re going to aim for somewhere between 10 and 15 points across our peak, that\u0026rsquo;s a really good range to be in. And 12 would kind of be that sweet spot. Goldstar. Yeah.\nSlide #  And it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to do, once you\u0026rsquo;ve determined your chromatography is what you want. We\u0026rsquo;ve already done all the compound optimization, you just run a standard, go ahead, copy retention times and paste them right back into your analytical method. And you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go. You have your scheduled MRM method so easy is that you get a lot of benefits in terms of data quality.\nStep 3: Source Optimization #  So are we happy with our chromatography we\u0026rsquo;re happy with our comment up? Last, we have to optimize for our source conditions. Slide: On-column source parameter optimization #  So the way I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you how to optimize for source conditions might be a little bit different than what you\u0026rsquo;re used to. This is my preferred method is called on Column source parameter optimization. The real difference here is that I\u0026rsquo;m not infusing anything. So in the past, maybe you used a column split T\u0026rsquo;s. But essentially what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is using a syringe pump to infuse your compound of interest. And then also, using your LC, to sort of introduce your mobile phase. Here, what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is we\u0026rsquo;re taking a sample with our standard with all the compounds we\u0026rsquo;re interested in. Since we know our chromatography, and we\u0026rsquo;d have them optimized, we\u0026rsquo;re just going to inject it. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to try basically a ton of different source conditions, and we\u0026rsquo;ll get the optimal one.\nSlide: Optimize five parameter of ion source #  And the reason I like doing this is because when we look at the parameters that we\u0026rsquo;re optimizing, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be really dependent on flow rate and mobile phase composition. So we talked a lot about our source conditions last time in the sense of what they are. But just to kind of briefly reintroduce them, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be optimizing for these five parameters, primarily our GS1, which is what\u0026rsquo;s going to help us create that nice spray, that\u0026rsquo;s going to let us ionize our compound, we have our GS2 and our temperature, these kind of work in tandem. So we want to promote evaporation. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to use a little bit of gas to help the evaporation in addition to our temperature, obviously, to help that. And then we\u0026rsquo;re also going to do our curtain gas (CUR), that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s keeping our instrument clean. So that\u0026rsquo;s that gas coming out from behind our curtain plate. That helps keep all those neutrals and other things that we don\u0026rsquo;t want in our mass back out. And then our iron spray voltage (ISV). So this is the actual voltage we\u0026rsquo;re applying to promote that ionization. And since these kind of depend on our flow rates, they depend on our mobile phase composition to a point, I like to do an on column. And one example that I have is I was working with a lab that was doing some cannabis analysis. And they did their source optimization, everything looked good. They\u0026rsquo;re doing it by just refusing their standard. And they had their LC set to 50-50 in terms of 50%, water, 50% ethanol. And then when they went to actually run the method, what they noticed is they weren\u0026rsquo;t seeing any peaks in the beginning of the chromatogram. And they\u0026rsquo;re having a really hard time figuring it out. So fill out there and that what was happening was essentially, kind of easy to see. Because if you looked at the source, they were essentially just washing their curtain plate, they had set the temperature so low, because they\u0026rsquo;re using more organic when they did their optimization, that when they did their starting conditions, which was 100% water, all the water was just rinsing off the curtain plate, going into their source exhaust and causing them a bunch of issues. So just my little example of why I choose to do it this way. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s easier to\nSlide #  so we\u0026rsquo;re gonna go ahead and tell our instrument what we want it to run, in a sense, we tell it the chromatography method that we\u0026rsquo;ve already developed, we tell it the compounds it\u0026rsquo;s going to look for with their optimized parameters. And then we\u0026rsquo;re just going to choose some generic source conditions. So these will vary a little bit depending on the source that you have. But here\u0026rsquo;s just some of my sort of generic starting conditions. And really, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a difference. As long as you can see the compounds you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, we\u0026rsquo;re going to optimize for these. So if you can see the compound you\u0026rsquo;re good to go. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it too much.\nSlide #  So when we do optimize for these conditions, what are we doing, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go ahead and inject that sample, and we\u0026rsquo;re gonna inject it a lot. So I like to set this up overnight. And we\u0026rsquo;re basically going to put it through the paces and run all the conditions we want. So for curtain gas, for example, the minimum curtain gas I would run on a method would be about 30 psi. But I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and inject my standard at 30 psi, I\u0026rsquo;m going to inject it again at 35 injected, again, pre injected again at 45. And then plot the data. So when I plot the data, I should see maybe an increase maybe 45, that gives me the most intensity, versus 35, etc. And when you do that for all my variables, so inside, so so there\u0026rsquo;s a nice little script that will do this for you. You can do the same thing and analyst as well. But if you have a lot of analytes, sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll just make the methods and just change the variables myself. It kind of depends a little bit on your personal preference.\nSlide #  So here\u0026rsquo;s an example of what that looks like. So I have Avermectin here. And I have different iron spray voltages. So I\u0026rsquo;m starting at 35 down here, and I\u0026rsquo;m moving up to 5000. And what we see is sort of this increase in area as we increase that voltage. So what you\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking is that might be true for Avermectin but what if that\u0026rsquo;s not true for something else in your panel, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more than one thing, and that happens, that happens a lot. And what you end up having to do is make compromises. so Avermectin I like to show because it\u0026rsquo;s very temperature sensitive. So it looks a really really low source temperature compared to something a different pesticides like pyrethrins, which like a really warm or hot source temperature. So I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of got to choose a middle ground. And since I struggle with my sensitivity on my Avermectin, I choose to use a lower source temperature. And those are kind of some of the hard choices that you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to make when you make your own method. But you can plot all of them, get an idea, choose your best values, and then you\u0026rsquo;re good to go.\nSlide #  So method development, whether you\u0026rsquo;re adding a compound, or you\u0026rsquo;re building a method from scratch, it should be pretty straightforward, you follow any steps, but you can see there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of flexibility in all of those steps, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lot of choices that you need to make, that are going to be specific to your goals. So just like always encourage you to think about your goals first. So if your goal is to have the fastest highest throughput method, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna make some different choices than if your goal is to have the most resolution. So if you are in a government lab, where you maybe want to separate isomers, for some research purpose, you might want to choose a really long method. And that\u0026rsquo;s fine. Versus if you are in a lab, and you\u0026rsquo;re running customer samples, and you need to turn around and make a profit. Running a shorter method is going to be more important to you. So just ask yourself, what your goals are, and why you\u0026rsquo;re or what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish with your method.\nSlide #  But regardless, go ahead, plan ahead, that development takes time. And since we live in a world where there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of regulation, which we all know, once we validate a method, it becomes very hard to change. So make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re happy with your method from the beginning. And taking notes is also my my next biggest push. So if you have those five fragments, for example, all recorded in the future, when you go to do your chromatography or inject your first Matrix sample, and you notice there\u0026rsquo;s a huge interference, you haven\u0026rsquo;t wasted any time, you can just go back to your notebook or your other method and pull a new transition. So take the notes, and take your time during these method development stages.\nSlide #  And if you are interested in sort of the step by step approach, if you want to know how to optimize a compound, where to click when you click, SCIEX Now Learning Hub is a great tool. We also have some courses open now on our sites. So you can come out that\u0026rsquo;s actually what I did a long time ago, when I first started doing some QToF analysis, flew out to the safe sight and did their training. And I really enjoyed it. So check out the Online Learning Hub if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for those more sort of step by step instructions. And with that, if there are any questions, I\u0026rsquo;d be happy to answer them.\nQ\u0026amp;A #  Q#1\nThank you, Karl, for sharing that great information. And now we will move on to the question and answer session of the presentation. We have some questions about source optimization, Karl, and you were discussing optimizing the source. What\u0026rsquo;s an approach if you have five or six unique analytes, Or more analyzed with different chemical properties? And how do you go about source optimization when looking at different classes in one methodology?\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a great question. So when I do source optimization, regardless, if I\u0026rsquo;m looking at two analytes, or if I\u0026rsquo;m looking at 150 analytes, I really take the same approach. And I really liked that on column approach, because I can add everything to the MRM method, I know when these things are eluding. So as long as I choose sort of generic source parameters, where I can see all of those compounds, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and step through each one of those sorts of different variables, GS1, GS2, temperature, etc. Until it to find an optimal value. But if your question is more, how do we make those tough choices? You know, sacrificing one\u0026rsquo;s intensity for another? I think the real answer is you have to look at the limits that you\u0026rsquo;re trying to hit. So what is that lower limit that you want to hit or need to hit if it\u0026rsquo;s regulated? And make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re achieving those in those difficult compounds first.\nQ#2\nExcellent, insane light a compound optimization when you\u0026rsquo;re doing infusion? Should you be running mobile phase at the same time, or should you be working purely from infusion standards?\nReally good question. And that actually has come up quite a bit with customers in the past. So what I typically like to do is when I prepare that standard for infusion, I\u0026rsquo;ll actually use my mobile phase to make that dilution. So I\u0026rsquo;ll take my neat standard and I\u0026rsquo;ll dilute it into my mobile phase. So you can do have 50-50 of each if you want, or you could just do your organic if it has some formic acid. But you\u0026rsquo;re absolutely right, you want some of that modifier in there to prove out that ionization, like we talked about.\nQ#3\nExcellent. The next question is around, what do you perform the source optimization at towards the end? You talked about kind of reoptimizing at the end of why do you do it in that specific order?\nYeah. And the reason being is that, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of where it falls, right? Because for my compound optimization, I don\u0026rsquo;t really need any information about source conditions. There\u0026rsquo;s no chromatography. So I can do that first. So that\u0026rsquo;s why we choose to do that first. And we\u0026rsquo;ll need that those compound parameters in order to do our chromatography, right. So we\u0026rsquo;ll need to choose our compounds, optimized for them, etc. And for source optimization, if you\u0026rsquo;re doing the on column approach, you\u0026rsquo;ll need both the chromatography and those compound parameters. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of just where it falls in the process of things.\nQ#4\nExcellent. Also, you\u0026rsquo;ve discussed matrix interference and suppression, how do you go about determining if you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing suppression? And if so when do you get indications that you should adjust your chromatography to account for that? Good question. Great question. And some of the clues. So there are a few different clues that you\u0026rsquo;re experienced depression, and suppression can happen in a few different ways. Right. So one way I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced it quite a bit is actually in the source. So I have source depression. And one of the big clues that I\u0026rsquo;m having an issue with source depression is if I run a calibration curve, and I have my internal standard in there, and as my concentration and my calibration curve increases, I\u0026rsquo;ll start to see this decrease in my internal standard over time. And that\u0026rsquo;s because there\u0026rsquo;s only so much that can be ionized at the same time, right and my source. So essentially, my internal standard and my compound of interest, or my analyte, that I\u0026rsquo;m actually measuring, are competing for that ionization. So I get some source suppression. That source suppression can happen with internal standard, of course, but it could also happen with anything in the matrix as well. So if you\u0026rsquo;re seeing something like that, one option is dilution. Dilution can really help with suppression and matrix interferences.\nQ#5\nExcellent. We have some questions around column choice as well. And the first is around does column choice and column chromatography, change and impact intensity? Yeah, yep. So kinda like what it showed in the example with Irganox, 1076, and 1135. You saw that difference in intensity between the F5 and the C8 and C18. So it was just not doing as good of a job selecting for that compound. So you will see differences in intensity, for sure. And then when we get into things like a particle size, and even column length, that\u0026rsquo;s where you can also see changes in intensity. So it might be the same stationary phase might be just to C18 like the other C18, but if it has a smaller particle size, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely see a more sort of narrow, intense peak than larger particle size.\nQ#6\nExcellent. As we know, there is a tolerance for retention time, do you have any rule of thumb of how you might select or set your retention time tolerances for a method?\nAbsolutely, I usually default to the sort of old adage of plus or minus point one seconds, or point one minutes, so I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. So about six seconds, that\u0026rsquo;s usually my acceptable sort of wiggle room in terms of my my peak actually shifting. But what I might do if I\u0026rsquo;m setting up a scheduled method is sort of broaden or make that window a little bit bigger than that, in case something does happen. So you know, maybe this one sample prep method was a little wonky, or something happened, something occurred got really hot in my lab, and my mobile phase warmed up a ton and my retention time started to shift. For my window that I\u0026rsquo;m looking at, I\u0026rsquo;ll usually allow it to be about 20 seconds.\nQ#7\nExcellent. The next question is around data points and data quality, how many data points do you generally require or suggest to ensure reproducibility and high data quality?\nYeah, so 10 to 15 is sort of that good range for points across the peak. And then 12 would be the ideal area or the ideal range to be in mid value. And the way we\u0026rsquo;re kind of determining that or the way to determine that would be to go ahead, look how wide your peak is. So I\u0026rsquo;ll do easy math, because It makes it easier for me. If your peak was 10 seconds across, we want to have our cycle time to be roughly a second. So if our cycle time was a second, we will get 10 points across our peak. So the amount of analysts you have is kind of going to dictate, because I did see that question about 12 volume, or dwell time is going to dictate that dwell time. So they kind of is an interchangeable play. But usually you want to adjust your cycle time accordingly to get enough points across to be.\nQ#8\nexcellent. The next question is also in regards to dwell time. And how big of an impact does dwell time have on analytical sensitivity and intensity of a given peak?\nYeah, it can have a big impact. So I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention it. But typically, we want to make sure our dwell time, in a perfect world, somewhere around 50 milliseconds would be great. Obviously, that\u0026rsquo;s not achievable for everything. But we really don\u0026rsquo;t want to dip too much below sort of 10 milliseconds, because when we do, we\u0026rsquo;ll start to see sort of variability in our peak intensity, and also just a little bit less intensity. So if you think about it from just like a very high level, right, we\u0026rsquo;re giving the instrument more time to do something. And as we give him more time to do something, it does a better job. So if we can get into that 50 millisecond range, we\u0026rsquo;re in a really nice spot in terms of our data quality.\nQ#9\nExcellent. We have another one in regards to chromatography optimization, and, uh, you know, wide panel or large panel. So if you have a sample that contains analytes, with a wide range of pKas, maybe anywhere from three to nine in the specimen, how do you determine what\u0026rsquo;s the right pH to provide optimum chromatography? Or what\u0026rsquo;s the strategy for that?\nGood question. And that\u0026rsquo;s a tough position to be in for sure. It\u0026rsquo;s going to depend a little bit, I\u0026rsquo;d say what ionization mode you\u0026rsquo;re using. So it kind of comes this area of what fits best for most. And you can do other things. So for when I do polymer analysis, for example, I will add formic acid, and I\u0026rsquo;ll also add ammonium for me, because I have two goals. One, I want to promote ionization, but two, I\u0026rsquo;m almost always looking at that ammonium adduct. So I want to make sure there\u0026rsquo;s a nice healthy supply of ammonium in my sample to kind of promote that adduct for me. So that might be an option, that you can go ahead and try adding two modifiers. If that\u0026rsquo;s kind of your goal, but in general, I would say go ahead, try something like formic acid, which is going to work for the majority of things and kind of assess where you\u0026rsquo;re at. If there are a few compound classes that are giving you trouble. That\u0026rsquo;s where you might kind of get into that range where you can say, hey, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m going to try something different.\nQ#10\nExcellent. We have a couple of questions about mobile phases. The first is, is methanol preferable? How do you choose between methanol and acetonitrile?\nYeah. The the correct answer would be to try both and see what happens. But if that\u0026rsquo;s not an option, there are some advantages of methanol over acetonitrile, methanol one would be less expensive. So if you\u0026rsquo;re talking about a cost per sample basis, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s where you make your choice. And then typically, acetonitrile is a little bit stronger. So if you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with sort of this more nasty, difficult complex matrices, acetonitrile will do a better job cleaning off your column and also give you a little bit more resolution.\nI would again like to thank you, Karl, for the informative presentation. And thank you for joining us today. We hope you found the presentation informative, and we look forward to seeing you at the next LCMS 101 session.\n"},{"id":37,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Sciex-Courses/03_Effective_data_processing/","title":"03 Effective Data Processing","section":"Sciex LC-MS/MS 101","content":" Video: 03 Effective Data Processing\nHello, and welcome to this session of LC-MS/MS 101. Effective data processing, where you can learn tips and tricks to get the most out of your data. Quickly. I\u0026rsquo;m Crystal Holt with ScieX, and I\u0026rsquo;m your moderator today. Today we\u0026rsquo;re joined with speaker Dr. Karl Oetjen. Dr. Karl ocean is a senior scientist at science, driving food, environmental forensics, clinical and cannabis applications. Before joining Sciex, he completed his PhD at the Colorado School of Mines, where his research focused on non targeted characterization of complex surfactant mixtures, including aqueous film forming foams, which led to the discovery of several per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances that since have been found in a variety of environmental samples, and industrial chemicals. Since joining sax, Karl has worked with numerous labs, creating and implementing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. And now I\u0026rsquo;ll turn it over to Karl.\nThanks, Crystal. So today we\u0026rsquo;re gonna be talking about some data processing. So if we think about data processing, or we think about LCMS analysis, aside from sample prep, we\u0026rsquo;re probably going to be spending the majority of our time doing data processing, right. Once we have our method set up, like we discussed in the last section, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much good to go. And now it\u0026rsquo;s time for us to get on the computer, start analyzing our unknown samples, and start building our curves. So just a really quick, brief, high level reminder of what we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about today. When we think about quantification, what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is we\u0026rsquo;re really, our main goal is to go ahead and quantify unknown samples. So to do that, we\u0026rsquo;re building a calibration curve, right? So we\u0026rsquo;re taking known samples with known concentrations, and we\u0026rsquo;re plotting them, we\u0026rsquo;re plotting the area specific to the concentration. And what that allows us to do is that when we find ourselves in scenarios where we have an unknown sample, so say, Here\u0026rsquo;s my unknown sample, I can go ahead and get a value. So I can say, hey, in my unknown sample, there\u0026rsquo;s actually 2000 puka grams per mil, of this particular analyte. So that\u0026rsquo;s really our goal. For from building our method to getting here, this is this is the end goal, this is our goalpost of what we really want to accomplish today. But how do we do that efficiently? So during the last poll, we sent out just some of the areas of interest. And it seemed like everybody was pretty interested in mostly everything. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to kind of touch on some of the highlights there, and some tips and tricks to process some data efficiently and effectively.\nSlide #  So before we build our calibration curve, the first step is to integrate our peaks. So how do we do that? Well, there are a few different scenarios that you might find yourself in, I certainly have found myself here before, where your integration algorithm, whichever one you may be using, went ahead and integrated a matrix interference along with your peak. So how do we sort of address this issue? The first option would be to go ahead, and I like to call it making a foot. But really, what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is splitting the valey between those two peaks. So between our interference and our analyte of interest, and sort of predicting where that baseline would be. So we\u0026rsquo;re recruiting that foot or that sort of right angle, integration. So that\u0026rsquo;s one approach that we could do.\nThe next would be to go ahead and draw a tight baseline. So again, removing that matrix interference, integrating just straight across our peak. Both options are good options, it\u0026rsquo;s going to depend a little bit on who you\u0026rsquo;re reporting to what they think is acceptable. But the thing I want to kind of get across is that we need to be consistent. Regardless of whether you choose option one or two, we need to make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re consistent in the way we integrate our peaks. And you can kind of take a look and look at that area, it changes quite a bit from for each of the six when we\u0026rsquo;re including that interference. Two of which is chopped option two, it\u0026rsquo;s only three to the six. That\u0026rsquo;s a pretty big difference in area. So if we\u0026rsquo;re integrating inconsistently, we might have, you know, a calibration curve, that\u0026rsquo;s not the greatest, or worst case scenario. We might have some unknown samples that are being quantified in a way that\u0026rsquo;s not super accurate, and we really want to avoid that. All right, so we want to be consistent.\nSlide: Tailing #  [5:06] Another scenario, when it comes to integration that I see quite often is when you have a tailing peak and a noisy baseline. So let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;ve got this peak that\u0026rsquo;s tailing. In the last section, we really talked about chromatography, some of the things we can do to avoid this, but it\u0026rsquo;s the real world and sometimes peak tail, and there isn\u0026rsquo;t too much we can do about it. Maybe this compounds super polar, or maybe your sample composition has to be made in such a way that this is just the reality you have to live with. But what we don\u0026rsquo;t want to do is integrate our baseline too high, right, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to not include that tail. And you\u0026rsquo;ll see some times some integration algorithms will go ahead and try to cut that peak a little bit. So if you have that noisy baseline, it thinks, hey, this is where my peak ends. But there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a big difference between including the tail and not including the tail, right? So we want to make sure we\u0026rsquo;re consistently integrating under your entire peak, even if our chromatography is less than ideal.\nSlide: Smoothing #  So what other situations can we get into and what other variables can we control when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about integration, and probably the big one that we\u0026rsquo;re kind of all thinking of is smoothing. So if we kind of refresh ourselves to the first few sessions and talk about points across the peak, so each one of these points represents a time when data was measured. So every one of these points is when the mass spec gave us some piece of information between these points are essentially the straight lines, just drawn to connect the points. And if you look at the top of this peak, which is unsmoothed, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice there\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of sort of a sharp edge. And that\u0026rsquo;s just because that\u0026rsquo;s where those points fall. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we end up with when we just draw straight lines between points, right. But what we want to do with smoothing is go ahead and sort of remove some of these inconsistencies and some of the variability that we might experience just based on where our points fall across our peak. And those points really are just related to the cycle time. So how many MRM experiments we have, and how long we\u0026rsquo;re allowing those experiments to continue. So the dwell time. So it might change from run to run. So we want to make sure that that variability is minimized.\nSlide: Over-smoothing #  [7:24] And an easy approach to sort of combat this would be smoothing. So in the blue, we have a peak that is not smooth, so you can kind of see a little rough around the edges, versus in the yellow where we have a one point smoothing. So the degree of smoothing is going to vary a little bit depending on which integration algorithm you\u0026rsquo;re using. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be pretty specific to Sciex software. But the theory is the same whether you\u0026rsquo;re using a GCMs or LCUV, or a different LC ms ms system, we want to smooth these peaks. So at one point smoothing would be considered a very low smoothing, or a very small amount of smoothing. And what you see is that peak download looks pretty Gaussian. So we\u0026rsquo;ve removed some of those rough edges, we haven\u0026rsquo;t really affected its intensity. And if we take a look at the area of the peak, we haven\u0026rsquo;t really manipulated the area too much either. Versus if we do something like a medium smooth or a two point smooth. Now we start to see that intensities decrease, although the area\u0026rsquo;s pretty consistent with the other two peaks. And then finally, if we went crazy and wanted to do something super wild, and integrate with or smooth with 10 points, so way, way, way, way over smooth, we noticed that we get this sort of short and fat peak. So instead of the nice six second peaks that we were observing before, now we have a peak that\u0026rsquo;s almost 30 seconds. And if we look at that intensity, we\u0026rsquo;ve lost two thirds or more of our intensity.\nSo why do we all want to avoid this? One, we\u0026rsquo;re sort of manipulating the data in a way that isn\u0026rsquo;t representative of what the true data was. And two and probably equally, if not more important, when we spread out that peak, we\u0026rsquo;re including more that baseline. so any noise, inconsistencies that are included in their baseline are going to be amplified and taken into account in our peak. And if we have a noisy baseline, it\u0026rsquo;s going to get harder to discern sort of our peak of interest from the baseline itself. So typically, somewhere in the low smoothing or the 1.2 points smoothing is where we want to live.\nSlide: Isomers #  How about isomers I get asked a lot about isomers. So here we have a floral chemical, and there are branched and linear isomers. So how do we address this? And the answer is going to depend a little bit based on your goals. Maybe you want to go ahead and quantify the linear isomers separately, which would be fine. But more commonly, folks want to sort of integrate this as a whole and report it as a single concentration since it\u0026rsquo;s the same Compound just isomers of that compound. So we\u0026rsquo;ll see this a lot in floral chemicals, but also things like pesticides, etc. So how do we do that? And how do we address this?\nSlide: Integrate Isomers #  So we talked about smoothing. But there are a few other variables that you kind of have control over to fine tune your integration, specifically, your automated integration, the first would be noise percentage. So the noise percentage is really how much of that baseline you\u0026rsquo;re considering. So as you go ahead and drop that number, so you make your noise percentage lower, you\u0026rsquo;re starting to include more and more of that baseline noise, versus if you make it higher, where you\u0026rsquo;re just sort of drawing a nice, tight peak. So if you had a single analyte, you would probably make this noise percentage somewhere in the 80-90%. Versus here where we\u0026rsquo;re trying to integrate some isomers, we\u0026rsquo;re going to lower that down. Baseline subtraction window, that\u0026rsquo;s pretty self explanatory. That\u0026rsquo;s how much of the baseline you\u0026rsquo;re considering. So how much of a window you want to look out. So 30 seconds, for example. And then probably the the most important variable in this scenario, which would be peak splitting. So if we think back to that previous slide with all those dots along our peak, peak splitting is essentially saying how many points between two peaks need to exist for those to be considered two peaks. So if I set that value to one, there would only need to be one of those points between two peaks for that to be considered two peaks, versus here where we have 10. So we\u0026rsquo;re saying, hey, I want you to include these other isomers as a single integration. So depending on what your goal is, you\u0026rsquo;d either lower or raise that, in this case, we\u0026rsquo;re going to increase it because we want to integrate our isomers together. So those four variables would be sort of the keys to really optimizing your automatic integration, your automated integration.\nSlide #  [12:00] So we\u0026rsquo;ve integrated our peaks, now comes time for sort of the meat and potatoes of any quantification method. And that\u0026rsquo;s really to quantify, right? So how do we quantify?\nSlide: Internal Standard and Surrogates #  So we talked about curves, but what are some of the other variables that come into play when we talk about quantification, and two big variables, that folks had a lot of interest in our internal standards and surrogates. So what is an internal standard? What is the surrogate, and how are they different? So internal standards, and surrogates usually are one of these three types of compounds. First, it would be a stable leaved labeled isotope. So in this case, we have a native flora chemical, and we have a internal standard that has two C13. So slightly different mass. This is sort of the gold star. So this is what we would really kind of strive for. And in the best case scenario, what we really want, since we\u0026rsquo;d expect these two compounds to act very, very similarly, in the source in during the matrix or in our matrix, for example. But it\u0026rsquo;s not always possible. Sometimes statically labeled things just don\u0026rsquo;t exist. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just too expensive to be practical for your method. And if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, we have two more options that we can kind of choose from, when it comes to internal standards and surrogates.\nThe first would be, we can choose something that\u0026rsquo;s just very similar to the compound of interest. So I\u0026rsquo;ve got flurochemical here, I could choose another fluorochemical, that I don\u0026rsquo;t think will be my sample. And that\u0026rsquo;s really the key. We want to make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s not in our sample. So we want to choose something that just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense for it to be there. But it\u0026rsquo;s structurally similar to our actual compound interest. And if that\u0026rsquo;s not possible, then we might just go ahead and say, Hey, let\u0026rsquo;s just choose a compound that is not similar to a compound of interest. But we definitely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect in our samples. This is a scenario that you can find yourself in depending on different circumstances. I personally have had to do this. When I was working with oil and gas wastewater, we would use antidepressants as our internal standards, because there just weren\u0026rsquo;t even analytical standards available for the compounds of interest that we were looking at. And it would be pretty unusual to find in a depressions few 1000 feet underground. So we felt pretty good about using those as sort of a way for us to assess how well our method is working. And the key here is we\u0026rsquo;re really going to add these add a known concentration.\nSlide #  So if they\u0026rsquo;re the same thing, or they can be the same thing, just different compounds, what makes an internal standard and a surrogate different. So the big takeaway here is that a surrogate is going to be added before sample extraction. So we have our chemist here, he\u0026rsquo;s doing some SPE he\u0026rsquo;s going to go ahead and add his surrogate first, then he\u0026rsquo;s going to go through the sample extraction, versus an internal standard, and an internal standard is added after. So after the sample extraction, whatever that may be, typically, this is pipetted, directly into your auto sampler file, for example, had a known concentration. So two very different things. And they really helped us in two very different ways.\nSlide #  So, an internal standard is very good at helping us account for any LC variability that might occur. So let\u0026rsquo;s say my autosampler needed picked up a little bit of air during one injection, and we want to normalize for that. Or any sort of suppression that\u0026rsquo;s occurring because of the matrix, our internal standard is what we\u0026rsquo;re going to lean on to correct for that, versus a surrogate, which is really getting at covery. And any variation that might occur during the sample preparation process. So maybe I was a little sloppy when I was doing my SPE and a little bit of sample spill. The surrogate will help me account for this.\nSlide #  And what does it look like? What are these scenarios look like? And how do we use internal standards. So here I have a curve, that I pipetted and [???] that I have this one point that\u0026rsquo;s sort of lower than what we\u0026rsquo;d expect. My line is a curve is not very linear, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be very happy with this. I go back, and it turns out, oops, when I was submitting my batch, I was supposed to inject three microliters for all my samples and standards, and I accidentally only injected two. So it\u0026rsquo;s giving me sort of this decrease in area counts. So if I use my internal standard to correct for this, what happens is that it get this nice linear line. Obviously, this isn\u0026rsquo;t what I should do, I should go ahead and reinject three, analyze. But let\u0026rsquo;s just say in this scenario, the samples no longer exist, the standards no longer exist. For some reason, I can\u0026rsquo;t drop this point, I need to make this data acceptable.\nSlide #  So how\u0026rsquo;s it doing that normalization. And it\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple. So it\u0026rsquo;s really just taking the analyte area and dividing it by the internal standard area. So remember, we\u0026rsquo;re adding that internal standard to all of our standards and samples at the same concentration. So that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t change that area should be consistent. And then we\u0026rsquo;re plotting that against the analyte concentration, versus the internal standard concentration. So if we think back to that previous slide, what I essentially did was, say, oh, there\u0026rsquo;s only two thirds as much internal standard present in my sample. So when I divided by that two thirds, I increased my response or that ratio. And that gave me that nice linear curve.\nSlide: How much IS should be added? (1) #  [18:02] But how do I know how much to add? So I\u0026rsquo;m adding the same amount every sample? But what if I add too little or too much? How do I sort of come up with that value? And this is a scenario that I find, actually pretty common. I\u0026rsquo;ve had lots of people approached me with this sort of issue. So I figured it\u0026rsquo;d be a good one to talk about. So here we have the internal standard area plotted over time, over this seven samples, or in this case, sorry, six samples. So these are my standards, at very, very different concentration levels. So standard one is my lowest concentration, standard six is my highest concentration. And what I\u0026rsquo;m observing here is a decrease in my internal standard area. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make sense, right? I know that I added my internal standard at the same value in all of these standards, so the area should be consistent. And essentially, what we\u0026rsquo;ve seen here is source saturation. So we\u0026rsquo;ve added too much internal standard. And if we think back to session one and session two, where we talked about ionization. So if we\u0026rsquo;re using the same isotopically labeled standard, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be eluding at the exact same time, more or less as our analyte of interest. And they\u0026rsquo;re both competing to be ionized. So if we have a lot of internal standard, and we also have a really high standard concentration, we have those two things competing with each other. So we\u0026rsquo;re essentially getting some source of saturation only so much can be ionized at one time. And that\u0026rsquo;s why we sort of see this decreasing trend. So we want to avoid that.\nSlide: How much IS should be added? (2) #  So the level we should use when sort of choosing an internal standard concentration should be somewhere in the middle of your curve. So we want to basically make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s not at a high enough concentration that we\u0026rsquo;re observing any source saturation, but it\u0026rsquo;s present in a value that is enough that we see it above our baseline. There\u0026rsquo;s no worry about it being lost in some sort of interference, and it\u0026rsquo;s reproducible. So somewhere in the middle of your curve of the low middle of your curve is usually a really safe place to start. Also, the less you use, the cheaper it will be. So kind of a GET TO for one there.\nSlide #  Awesome. So we\u0026rsquo;ve gone ahead and quantified, but how do we be confident in our data? And this is where QA QC becomes really important. And how do we communicate to others that yes, this is the true value for this unknown sample, because that\u0026rsquo;s our goal.\nSlide #  [20:46] So I just have an example of a batch here, it may vary a little bit depending on what kind of assays you run. But it\u0026rsquo;s a typical quantification, or quantitation batch where we have some blanks, a series of standards, usually between five and seven. And then we have some QC\u0026rsquo;s. And what you\u0026rsquo;ll notice here is that I have my samples bookmarked between QC\u0026rsquo;s and blanks, and that\u0026rsquo;s intentional. So typically, I would run 10 samples in between my PCs and blanks. And I\u0026rsquo;m using those QCs to determine if my curve is still valid. And so if I\u0026rsquo;ve been running for, let\u0026rsquo;s say, 72 hours, and it\u0026rsquo;s been 72 hours, since I ran my calibration curve, I want to make sure that that calibration curve is still appropriate for quantification. And blanks. blanks are really important to determine if there is any carryover present. So these little bookmarks will help make sure that my data is of high quality.\nSlide #  But how do I assess is this good? Is my curve good? Is it acceptable? So I\u0026rsquo;ll go over some of the more common ways. So typically, when we\u0026rsquo;re assessing the calibration curve, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be using R squared. So an R squared value of above point nine, nine is usually considered acceptable. But that might vary a little bit depending on what method you\u0026rsquo;re performing. And then we\u0026rsquo;re going to use accuracy. So our accuracy is going to be how close is our predicted concentration to our known concentration. So we know the standard was at let\u0026rsquo;s say, 10 parts per million, how close is the calculated concentration to 10 parts per million. And a acceptable range usually is between 20 and 30%. Sometimes, depending on if you\u0026rsquo;re following a certain regulated method, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that the LLQ, or that low limit of quantitation will have a more lenient accuracy, sort of band, up to plus or minus 50% in some cases. But the takeaway here is that we want it to be between 20 and 30%, we want that R squared to be acceptable. And when we have that we basically have this narrow range or hopefully pretty wide range that we can quantify between so between our LLQ and or upper LOQ so everything above that upper LOQ we can\u0026rsquo;t quantify anything below that lower LOQ. We also can\u0026rsquo;t quantify. There has been sort of some discussion about using other approaches for validating calibration curves, especially with the EPA. And there seems to be some headway. They\u0026rsquo;re using things like root mean square error. But since this is the more common way, and we\u0026rsquo;ll just talk about that for now, and it\u0026rsquo;s likely those will sort of come around for the next couple of years.\nSlide: Regression Weighting Factors #  [23:44] So we\u0026rsquo;ve made a curve, but we haven\u0026rsquo;t talked about weighting. And weighting is really common, and also really important in LCMS analysis. So on the left hand side in the purple box, we have a calibration curve. And we have no weighting applied to it. So it\u0026rsquo;s just our calibration curve. And if you look at it, at our low end, we\u0026rsquo;re getting some pretty high error well outside are acceptable 20 to 30%, right. So it\u0026rsquo;s doing a really bad job predicting the concentrations are calculating the concentrations of our lower standards and analyte and QC, etc. But it\u0026rsquo;s doing a great job at the high end. And this is kind of common for LCMS analysis. So what we typically do is apply a weighting factor. So one over x, which would be the more common weighting factor is going to apply a little bit of a bias to the lower end of your curve. So you can think of it as kind of I like to call it like shifting your curb. And what you see is that you get a much better accuracy at that low end. So instead of having 90% Now we\u0026rsquo;re down to around 20% at that low end, so it\u0026rsquo;s doing a much better job calculating those values. And we haven\u0026rsquo;t really sacrificed much on the high end We\u0026rsquo;re still well below that acceptable 20%. If we wanted to take it a step further, and wait that curve even more, we could use a one over x squared approach. And here we\u0026rsquo;d have a curve that\u0026rsquo;s doing a really excellent job predict or calculating the values at the low end. But at the high end, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s increased, still acceptable, but maybe to you, this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be acceptable, and you\u0026rsquo;d want to go with something a little more common, like the one over x. But regardless, I\u0026rsquo;d say most cases, you\u0026rsquo;ll find yourself requiring some sort of weighting to your curve.\nSlide: QC Sample Terminology #  And before we move into some of the calculations, that\u0026rsquo;s just kind of clean up some of the terminology. So you notice in my batch, I had blanks and double blanks. So at least the way I use these terms, and the way I find most folks use these terms, a double blank would be essentially a solvent blank, or the matrix that you\u0026rsquo;re injecting, with nothing in it, versus a blank, which would include internal standard, typically. And these, again, really great at assessing carryover, I always recommend running a blank after your high standard to make sure that you are experiencing any of those issues, versus our low QC and our high QC. So these would be a quality control sample and a known concentration at the low end of the curve, and a quality control sample at the high end of your curve at a known concentration. So again, these are just being used to assess that your curve is accurate, you\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job sort of predicting or calculating your unknown samples concentrations, even if it\u0026rsquo;s been hours or days, since you last ran a calibration curve. in some labs, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re coming from the GC world, you may be well run QCs. And if your GCS are passing, you don\u0026rsquo;t even run a calibration curve until those QC fail. So it will depend a little bit based on your lab setup and two years sort of reporting to.\nSlide: Matrix effect and Extraction Recovery #  All right, so how do we use those samples to give us some, some data. So matrix effect and extraction recovery are two big pieces of data that we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to understand from a method standpoint, and also want to assess, I\u0026rsquo;d say a batch to batch standpoint. So typically, best practices would be to go ahead and extract a matrix blank with every sample batch that you produce, and to go ahead and extract a spiked matrix sample, and they kind of give us two different but important pieces of information.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with matrix effect. So the matrix effect, how much is there a matrix impacting our results. So here, we are doing this, without taking into account any part of the extraction. So we are taking our matrix, in this case would probably be our matrix blank, and spiking our standard on top of that matrix blank, or then dividing it by the area of the neat standard. So we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about things like recovery. Any losses that are coming from the sample extraction, we\u0026rsquo;re just taking an account that matrix, so we\u0026rsquo;re trying to figure out is there any suppression or enhancement. So since we\u0026rsquo;re normalizing to 100, in a perfect world, this should be 100. When we talk about extraction recovery, here, we\u0026rsquo;re using that pre spike sample before extraction. And we\u0026rsquo;re dividing that by the standard area. And this is going to give us an idea of what our losses are, and the amount of loss that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable use going to kind of change. So maybe you can say plus or minus 30% is acceptable. That being said, if you\u0026rsquo;re using something like surrogates, you can go ahead and use those surrogates to correct for that. So that\u0026rsquo;s commonly referred to as an isotope dilution method. But you can even if you say have 50% recovery, well, you have that isotopically labeled surrogate that you can use to correct for any losses that are occurring during that extraction process. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s just something you want to monitor.\nSlide: Matrix Factor #  And when we talk about matrix factor, so matrix factor, also commonly referred to as matrix effect, depending on what circles you\u0026rsquo;re involved in here. we\u0026rsquo;re really trying to figure out is there enhancement or is there suppression? So in this case, I have my purple, which is my neat and my samples, which is my spiked matrix, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see that that peak is smaller than the purple peak. So if these were a one to one ratio, that\u0026rsquo;s great. We are seeing no matrix impact. Since it\u0026rsquo;s smaller though, what we\u0026rsquo;re essentially saying is yes, there is some suppression occurring. And again, that\u0026rsquo;s the more common especially as you get into Some of these more complicated and traditionally dirty or matrices, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re doing something like serum or soil or plasma suppression is something we all have to live with. And we can try to find ways to work around it like using surrogates and internal standards. enhancement is a little bit more unusual. Typically, if I see enhancement, it\u0026rsquo;s usually an APCI, over ESI. But I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it in ESI, too.\nSlide: Ion ratios #  And finally, when we want to be very confident in the data, we\u0026rsquo;re reporting ion ratios. So if we take a step back to session one and think about what the kind of experiment we\u0026rsquo;re doing, we\u0026rsquo;re doing an MRM experiment. So we\u0026rsquo;re using our Q one to filter for the parents, in this case, the 215. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to create some fragmentation. So when we create this fragmentation, we have a few 50 different fragments to choose from. So in this scenario, I went ahead and isolated for the 185. And that will be my MRM experiment. That being said, we could do a separate experiment and isolate for the 193. And if we wanted to use ion ratios, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we do.\nSlide #  So when we talk about ion ratios, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the ratio between the qualifier and the qualifier. So the qualifier is typically the most sensitive fragment, and that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to use to calculate a concentration. The qualifier is typically the second most sensitive fragment. And what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the ratio between these two. So if we just look at the pink peak, and the blue peak, the ratio here should be the same always. So when we calculate our ion ratio, we\u0026rsquo;ll divide our qualifier by our quantifier, or vice versa, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. But this is the way we typically do it at Sciex, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get your ion ratio. And we\u0026rsquo;re calculating this from our standards. So we know that analyte is in our standards, we know it\u0026rsquo;s a nice, neat analytical standard, that ratio should be the same whether we\u0026rsquo;ve injected one pika gram, or 100 pico grams, that ratio is going to stay the same. And we can use that in our unknown samples to be more confident in whether or not this is truly our analyte of interest.\nSlide #  In terms of what is acceptable versus what is unacceptable, typically, folks will use a constant tolerance. So plus or minus 20 to 30%. This works best when you\u0026rsquo;re quantifying qualifier or similar size. That\u0026rsquo;s not always the case, though. And if you find yourself in a situation where your qualifier is much, much, much smaller than your qualifier, using something like a variable tolerance might be more appropriate. And variable tolerance is really just saying, if my ratio is very small, then I will give myself more tolerance there, because there\u0026rsquo;s a small little change in that ratio is going to have a big effect versus if my ratio is pretty similar closer to one, I\u0026rsquo;ll use a tighter tolerance. So it will depend a little bit on your assay, and specifically the analytes of interest.\nSlide #  [33:20] So here, I have a sample. I\u0026rsquo;ve got this serum sample. And I\u0026rsquo;m looking for my analyte of interest. When I look at my standard, I\u0026rsquo;ve got my blue line and my pink line. And you\u0026rsquo;ll notice those horizontal lines represent what the ion ratio should be, with the finally data lines being the plus or minus 20%. Perfect. my qualifier looks great, it\u0026rsquo;s right where it should be. But when I look at my unknown sample, all of a sudden I say, oh, no, I don\u0026rsquo;t see my qualifier. So this would tell me something\u0026rsquo;s wrong. Likely it means that this is not my analyte of interest, that and that ratio should be the same. So maybe this is some sort of interference. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what this is. But I can be pretty confident it\u0026rsquo;s not the compound I was looking for. So I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to go ahead and report this as a positive. So that\u0026rsquo;s how you can use ion ratios to be really confident in the data you\u0026rsquo;re outputting.\nSlide #  So we\u0026rsquo;re confident now but how do we communicate some of these results? Communication is the most important part of what we do. Because for communicating to regulators, to non scientists, to other scientists, what our results are, so they can use those results for whatever application they might need, whether that be research or in a clinical world or in the environmental world for remediation. We need to communicate those results to other folks. So how do we do that?\nSlide #  And that\u0026rsquo;s where reporting comes into play. So reporting might not be the most interesting topic, but it is a very, very, very important topic. And there are a few different types of reports that kind of exist. And it will depend a little bit on who you\u0026rsquo;re communicating to. So one really common type of report would be a word processing report. So something like Microsoft Word, or even more commonly, PDF. Typically, PDFs are chosen just because they\u0026rsquo;re lockable so that someone can\u0026rsquo;t edit them. But again, it will depend on the environment that you\u0026rsquo;re in and who you\u0026rsquo;re reporting to. So the nice thing is about these types of documents are you can include images. So we talked about integration, for example, we may want to show our QA, QC department, our supervisor, how we integrated these peaks, so they\u0026rsquo;re confident that we\u0026rsquo;re doing it correctly. So we may want images of those peaks on our report, or we may be super proud of our calibration periods. And we want to include that calibration period on our report. So hey, yes, this is linear, everything is looking good. So these types of word processing reports are usually very good at that. downside to these reports, is as you start to add those images, especially if they\u0026rsquo;re high quality, they start to get really big. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever opened up a large Word document, you know how frustrating that can be sometimes. And also, it usually means that somebody has to review it. So you\u0026rsquo;re usually relying on a person to go through this report. So that can be a little tedious.\nAnother option would be a numeric and text based report. So these are equally as common. And here we are essentially using a text file. So we\u0026rsquo;re including any text we need to include and any numeric value. And because it\u0026rsquo;s just a text file, these files, even if they have 10,000 samples in them are still relatively small and easy to manage. And you may be taking this data and moving it into something like Excel, where you have a macro you\u0026rsquo;re running or R to do some further data analysis. I always try to avoid transposing data into other software\u0026rsquo;s if you can. We didn\u0026rsquo;t talk about it here. But there are some functions inside so so you can do a lot of those calculations from Excel right in the software. And anytime you can prevent or not transpose data into a different software, you eliminate sort of that risk of errors occurring. But these data files are super small, you can transfer them right to LIMS, share them between colleagues with with relative ease. But that makes them very editable, too.\nAnd then a LIMS system. So laboratory information management system, this is kind of the gold standard, I would say when it comes to managing labs that are producing a lot of data and a lot of samples. So this is an automated system that you can either drag that text based file into, or can link directly with the software looks X OS. So the data is going into this LIMS system, any further calculations that need to be done are being performed, any flagging that needs to be done is being performed. It can be a great approach, if you are sharing data with say a customer. And you want to have a nice sort of clean report at the very end. But some of the downsides here, they can be expensive, depending on what system you go with. If you build it in a house, it could be a lot of work. And you usually need someone to sort of be there to maintain it. Versus if you go to say another company, all great choices. And it\u0026rsquo;s really going to depend on who the end user is. So if you\u0026rsquo;re submitting a report to your QA, QC department, they\u0026rsquo;re gonna want to see integrated curves. If you\u0026rsquo;re submitting a report to a cannabis cultivator about what pesticides are in their sample, they don\u0026rsquo;t really need to see the integrated peaks and curves at imagine they really just care about that final concentration value.\nSlide #  [39:23] And that\u0026rsquo;s going to really dictate what information you put in your report. So typically, things like sample name, etc, would be very common to include in a header. But when you get down to the granularity of like, integration algorithm, for example, probably not super important to that cannabis cultivator, for example, but maybe really important to your supervisor. So I always recommend, after many, many years of building reports for folks to sit down as a group and discuss what data you really need to show? what data is absolutely necessary and what data if we need to go back and check we have the data files stored somewhere and we can look but it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary to be on my Report.\nSlide #  And the same would go for our table, which has our analytes or concentrations, usually retention time, what data do we absolutely need to show to communicate my results to someone else? And what data can we sort of document include? That\u0026rsquo;s just not relevant to this particular customer regulator, etc.\nSlide #  Awesome. So with that kind of wraps up some of our data processing, tips and tricks and how to be a little bit more efficient. Remember, it all starts with integration. So when we think about integration, the big thing I want to stress is to be consistent consistency is arguably the most important thing. So sit down with your group, decide on how you\u0026rsquo;re going to sort of address those kinds of situations that we talked about. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re a food lab, and you want to draw feet, or you want to draw a tight baseline and exclude that matrix interference. Either works, just make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re being consistent quantification, internal standards and surrogates. Although it\u0026rsquo;s an extra step can save you a lot of time and effort and also allow you to be a lot more confident in your data. So in addition to sort of the QA, QC, samples and approaches, having surrogates internal standards, can account for some of those crazy situations where maybe this one particular soil has a ton of suppression, and just gives you another tool in your toolbox that you can use to be confident in your data. And finally, communicating those results to others. Know your target audience when you\u0026rsquo;re when you\u0026rsquo;re creating these reports, because that\u0026rsquo;s going to really change what data you need to show and what data you need to include in your reports.\nSlide #  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in some step by step instructions on how to use say sax OS, or multiquant sound Learning Hub is great. It will walk you through building a process method to quantifying results to making your own reports. So if you want to sort of dive in and get into some of the neatty gritty, I really recommend you check out sacks. Now, those courses are mostly free, I think, if not all of them. So they\u0026rsquo;re great resources.\nQ\u0026amp;A #  Great, thanks, Karl, for the great presentation.\nQ#1\nSo the first question is around a double blank. You mentioned a double blank in the presentation. What how do you define a double blank? And how does the double blank vary from the standard definition of a blank?\nYeah. So I should mention that this is how I typically and how we SCIEX define double blanks, there may be some variability depending on the group you belong to. But a double blank usually is pretty similar to the solvent blank in the sense that it does not contain any analytes of interest. There\u0026rsquo;s no internal standard of surrogates, etc. So it should be pretty close to the solvent you\u0026rsquo;re injecting. Whereas a blank usually includes those internal standards. So that\u0026rsquo;s the big difference between the two.\nQ#2\nExcellent. The second question is around the use of internal standards, how do you correct for ion suppression using internal standards? And how do you correct for any recovery issues using surrogates? Can you comment on those?\nYeah, definitely. So that\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;re relying on that ratio. Right. So what we\u0026rsquo;re assuming when we use an internal standard is that internal standard should experience that suppression, similarly to that compound of interest. So if our analyte is experiencing suppression, our internal standard should also be experienced that suppression. So when we take the ratio, we\u0026rsquo;re essentially correcting for that. So when we take the analyte area over the internal standard area, we\u0026rsquo;re correcting for that suppression that we\u0026rsquo;ve observed, versus something like a surrogate. So a surrogate here, that, that does experience suppression, too, right. But we\u0026rsquo;re really using that information to get at our recovery and any sort of variability that we\u0026rsquo;re experiencing throughout our sample preparation. So there are a few different approaches on how you could use that. You could do the same thing that I just mentioned with the internal standard and normalized to your surrogate area instead. And that\u0026rsquo;s called an isotope dilution method. Or you could just monitor that make sure it\u0026rsquo;s within a sort of acceptable bounce. So it will depend a little bit on your goals and and how much recovery issues you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing.\nQ#3\nExcellent. Thanks, Karl. The second question is around how much is you talked about how much is and you mentioned, maybe put it in the middle of your range in the graph that looked like it was in the middle, or in the lower third. So can you clarify, do you use middle range as far as amount raw value of the analyte of interest? Or do you use your current level? So if you have five points, you put it closer to, you know, point three?\nGreat question. Yeah, yeah, that that is exactly what it meant. So I typically will use the middle part of my curve. But for me, if that\u0026rsquo;s around, you know, standard point three, that\u0026rsquo;s totally fine. What I\u0026rsquo;m really sort of getting at is to avoid having it be at the higher end of your curve. So you don\u0026rsquo;t experience that sort of depression. And also, I really want that value to be or that concentration to be at a point where I\u0026rsquo;m not worried about my baseline noise being too high. Or it\u0026rsquo;s at such a low level that I\u0026rsquo;m worried that there might be some variability between injections just because I\u0026rsquo;m sort of scraping the bottle, and they\u0026rsquo;re all in terms of sensitivity. So I just want to make sure that I have a nice strong signal, but not too high. I know that\u0026rsquo;s a little vague. But somewhere in that middle range is usually where I\u0026rsquo;ll shoot.\nQ#4 Thanks, Karl. The next question is also around amount, but it\u0026rsquo;s in relation to QC\u0026rsquo;s, we also discussed the low and the high QC, how do you go about determining what a relatively good concentration level for your loan high QC might look like?\nYeah, great question. And some labs will even include a midpoint QC. So it really is going to depend a little bit when I\u0026rsquo;m a notoriously lazy person when it comes to pipetting. So when I choose my mid and low, or my sorry, my low and high points, I usually use a very similar concentration to my standard, not the exact same concentration of the standard, because it makes it easier for me when I\u0026rsquo;m pipetting. But that\u0026rsquo;s been my approach, you can also go ahead and just choose something in between two values. So you\u0026rsquo;ll see a lot of folks use if you have standard four and five, their QC will be evaluated between standard four and five. And that just makes sure that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing, you know, accurate quantification of those QC\u0026rsquo;s.\nQ#5\nExcellent. The next question goes on to calibration curves. So if you have a good R squared value, the example given was like a point nine, nine. So you have excellent linearity within your calibration curve, should you still consider utilizing weighting? And if so why?\nGood question. And there\u0026rsquo;s been a lot of talk in the analytical community about whether r squared is really the best way to assess our curves. Traditionally, it\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ve always used. But maybe there\u0026rsquo;s some new approach that we can use to be a little bit more confident in our data. I\u0026rsquo;d say though, if you\u0026rsquo;re using R squared, and you have a great R squared value, to decide if you need to apply some weighting, it really depends on the accuracy of those standards. So when you look at the calculated concentration of your low calibration curve, versus your high end, if you are getting great values, you know all your errors below, whatever it might be acceptable to you to say 20% Feel free to forego the weighting. But if you notice that, hey, the bottom end of my curve is experiencing quite a bit of error compared to the high end of my curve. That\u0026rsquo;s when you may want to apply something like a one over x weighting.\nQ#6\nExcellent. Our next question is also around calibration curves. And you talks about different regression types linear quadratic fit, can you explain how you choose between the different fits? When would you go away from maybe a linear fit? And also in that? You mentioned a Wagner regression? Can you explain a little bit further on on Wagner regression and when it might be blessed?\nGood question. So I\u0026rsquo;ll I\u0026rsquo;ll say I\u0026rsquo;m a little bit of a purist, I pretty much always use a linear curve. Typically, in my experience, if I need to use a quadratic curve, there\u0026rsquo;s likely something I can fix in my method to correct for that. So I mentioned some source depression, for example, if you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing sourse depression, oftentimes you ended up with this sort of quadratic curve. So a good way to assess if you know, Hey, is that a carrier would be to plot your internal standard area over time, or I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, over the concentration levels, to see if you see that decrease. But typically, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be in a linear range. So if you do have that quadratic curve, I\u0026rsquo;d be worried that you\u0026rsquo;re experienced some saturation, whether that be at the detector or the source. That being said there are some cases where you just can\u0026rsquo;t avoid it. That\u0026rsquo;s just the nature of the beast. But in most cases, it\u0026rsquo;s something you can probably address with your method. And the same I\u0026rsquo;d say for for Wagner curve as well.\nQ#7\nExcellent. The next is about using standards and surrogates and the analyte How do you monitor isotope dilution analytes when you\u0026rsquo;re using internal standard surrogates or analyte calibration curves?\nyeah. So when we when we talk about isotope dilution, right, for those who are unfamiliar, we\u0026rsquo;re using that surrogate to essentially correct for those recovery differences that we might experience just due to sample prep or just the nature of that compound. So we\u0026rsquo;re, instead of using that internal standard, to correct for any variability, we\u0026rsquo;re using that surrogate area to correct for that variability. And depending on a method that you\u0026rsquo;re following, usually there\u0026rsquo;s an acceptable bounce for that surrogate recovery. So just like I showed in the previous slide, when you calculate that extraction, recovery, you do the same thing for all of your surrogates and ensure that it\u0026rsquo;s within whatever is acceptable to you, typically, that somewhere between 50 and 150%. And you\u0026rsquo;d want to monitor that value over time, you know that you\u0026rsquo;re adding the same amount to every sample. So really, in a perfect world, when you divided by the neat standard, you should see the post extracted standard, you should have a ratio of one or 100%.\nQ#8\nExcellent. The next question is around manual integration. So we talked a lot about the integration of the software, is manual integration, a practice that, you know, is considered acceptable, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s to accommodate for moving retention times? Or is the fact that you have to manually integrate indicative of a bigger problem?\nYes, great question. And I\u0026rsquo;d say if you find yourself having to manually integrate, often, then yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s probably indicative of a bigger problem. So if you find your retention time is shifting, often. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time for an ID column, or maybe there\u0026rsquo;s some air in your airlines that\u0026rsquo;s causing that a bigger problem than just just manually integrating. However, if you have an unusual sample, maybe with some bizarre interference that just isn\u0026rsquo;t present most of the time, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve seen it. That\u0026rsquo;s when manual integration can be a useful tool. The other case, where I see pretty commonly used is when you do have isomers. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t use the suggestion that I showed earlier with how to integrate them all, some folks will just draw a large line to integrate all of the the isomers together. So that would also be another sort of acceptable usage. This would be tedious if that\u0026rsquo;s your analyte of interest, and you have to do it every day for every sample.\nQ#9\nExcellent. Question around building applications for summing ions when you\u0026rsquo;re using quantity quantitation? What type of application? Would you use the sum of an ion? And we know that that\u0026rsquo;s capable in SCIEX OS, but if they\u0026rsquo;re acquiring data, or processing data using analyst or multiclient? Is that also a capability?\nYeah, certainly, regardless of the software you\u0026rsquo;re using, you can do summation. Personally, where I use it is when I do polymer analysis. So usually, I\u0026rsquo;m not super interested in calculating the concentration of all of the individual homologues. And instead, I just want a total concentration of the safe polyethylene glycol. So that\u0026rsquo;s when I would use summation. So if you find yourself in that point, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re doing some sort of protein analysis or something like that, summation might be a good option for me, polymer analysis is where I use it more frequently.\nThat is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to thank you for providing such insightful questions. And thank Karl for sharing that great information. I hope you enjoyed today\u0026rsquo;s session, and we will see you for the next LCMS 101 Have a great day.\n"},{"id":38,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Sciex-Courses/04_Maintenance_N_troubleshooting/","title":"04 Maintenance and Troubleshooting","section":"Sciex LC-MS/MS 101","content":" Video: 04 Maintenance and Troubleshooting\nHello, and welcome to LC MS, MS 101, part four, maintenance and troubleshooting, where you can come to learn tips and tricks to keep your systems in tip top shape. I\u0026rsquo;m Crystal Holt with ScieX, and I\u0026rsquo;m your moderator for today. Today I\u0026rsquo;m joined with Dr. Karl Oetjen. Dr. Karl Oetjen is a senior scientist driving food, environmental, forensics, clinical and cannabis applications at Sciex. Before joining Sciex he completed his PhD at Colorado School of Mines, where his research focused on non targeted characterization of complex surfactant mixtures, including aqueous film forming foams, which led to the discovery of several per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances that have since been found in a variety of environmental samples and industrial chemicals. Since joining Sciex, Karl has worked with numerous labs creating both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. And now I\u0026rsquo;ll turn it over to Karl.\nThanks, Crystal. And thanks, everybody, for joining us for the last session of the LCMS 101 series. And we\u0026rsquo;re gonna be talking about maintenance and troubleshooting. So something that\u0026rsquo;s really important, I\u0026rsquo;m sure all of us at this point have gotten to the lab and had an issue. And whether that issue meant downtime, or some corrective active action needed to take place. It can be frustrating. But there are a lot of tips and tricks we can do to kind of prevent these issues, which is the best case scenario, right? planned downtime is a lot easier to work around and unplanned downtime. And then inevitably, when these things happen, some things to kind of troubleshoot quickly and some just some tips to to get you there a little bit faster. So this will be broken up into three parts. First, we\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about some preventative maintenance and some regular maintenance that you can do on your mass spec and LLC. And then we\u0026rsquo;ll go through some data troubleshooting. So kind of a fun case study experiment where we look at some of the more common things we see here at Zach\u0026rsquo;s when it comes to issues.\nMass Spec Maintenance #  Slide #  [2:28] But first is kind of dive into this mass spec maintenance. So I took a second to think about what are some of the key things I think of when I think of preventative maintenance when I think of keeping my instrument up and running the things that we do in the lab here.\nAnd the first thing is, we always use our diverter valve. That might seem pretty simple, but it\u0026rsquo;s really important. So we talked about this during the fundamental session a little bit and certainly during the method development session, but that Diverter Valve are essentially putting towards waste when we\u0026rsquo;re not seeing our analytes of interest. So when our analysts of interests aren\u0026rsquo;t eluding, we can go ahead and have our flow go right to the waist. So typically, what that would look like is in the beginning of your method, let\u0026rsquo;s say your first peak Lutz at around three minutes, up until maybe 2.8 minutes, you\u0026rsquo;d have all your flow just go into your waist. So nothing has been introduced to your mass spec, which means all those salts, all those things that didn\u0026rsquo;t get retained by your analytical column, are just going into the trash essentially, the same thing you can do for the end of your gradient. So during that whole period, where you\u0026rsquo;re holding an organic after your last peak Lutz once your retention window or your MRM window has passed, you can go ahead switch that out the waist, and just like all of those more hydrophobic things that are sticking around on your column longer. Again, straight to your waist, never introduced your system. So just preventing your system from getting dirty, quicker.\nThe next thing that you can do that I always recommend doing, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re running a little bit dirty your samples. So maybe if you\u0026rsquo;re running something like a serum or you\u0026rsquo;ve done even if you\u0026rsquo;ve done you know a traditional protein crush, looking at a soil sample with some cleanup, just giving your instrument a quick wipe down daily is a great way to keep your instrument up and running longer. And this really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take very long. You come into the lab, you take off the source and you can take off that curtain play all without venting your instrument at all. So just connect your hardware profile, take off that curtain plate and give it a quick wipe down with the kimberlite. So take a chem wipe with some water you can add a little bit of acetic acid and some pseudo nitro and wipe off any sort of particulates that have built up on your curtain plate. So if you\u0026rsquo;re running a really nasty sample, I I always go back to cannabis because that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s one of the the nastier things I have to deal with. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice some some brown built up, we just want to eliminate that. So we ensure our items are getting into your mass spec the way we intended them to, again, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take more than two or three minutes.\nThe next thing you can also do is check that probe. So when it comes from our LC to our mass spec, we want to ensure that flow is proper, and we don\u0026rsquo;t have any clogs. So an easy way to do this. It\u0026rsquo;s just to allow our LC to flow to a mass spec with a mass spec, essentially in standby, and just watch for drips, we should see a constant drip out of that probe. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t see a pressurized spray, if your instruments in standby right. So we\u0026rsquo;ll just see concentrating. And that tells us there\u0026rsquo;s no clogs. If we do see a pressurized spray, that\u0026rsquo;s a big hint that, hey, there\u0026rsquo;s likely a clog in our probe, we can try to clean it, you can take it out and sonicated and methanol, for example, what are they nothing at all. Or you can just replace that electrode altogether, which is probably the best practice.\nAnd last but not least, our roughing pump. So this is something that I added in, based on a personal story of mine were I joined a lab and there was an old GCMs single quad in the corner. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone had used that instrument in maybe five or six years since I got there. And I certainly hadn\u0026rsquo;t touched it. And some time went by none of us had really paid attention to it, it seemed to be fine. And then we noticed there was quite a big oil spill underneath that aspect. And what had happened is over time, maybe years, the oil had drained out of that roughing pump and caused a lot of damage to that roughing pump, and we ended up having to replace it. So is that a silly accident where we didn\u0026rsquo;t check the oil on that roughing pump, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that can pass on to you guys is make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re taking a look ensuring that there\u0026rsquo;s enough oil and you\u0026rsquo;re roughing pump, your instrument is going to be able to stay up longer. And you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about maybe replacing a roughing pump or even worse some damage to your mass spectrometer. So something super easy to do every month or so just give a quick peek in that cabinet, it can be easy to forget that it\u0026rsquo;s still there, you\u0026rsquo;re roughing pump that is and make sure that oil is at an appropriate level.\nLC System and Column #  Slide #  [7:25] Next, we talk about the LLC. Let\u0026rsquo;s move to what can we do there just to make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re up and running as much as possible. So when we think about maintenance, from an LLC standpoint, one of the big things that I like to sort of bring up is to ensure that we\u0026rsquo;re changing our mobile bottles, mobile phase bottles frequently, it\u0026rsquo;s less important for the organic. But I\u0026rsquo;ve been to several labs where the mobile phase A or the aqueous looks more like a swimming pool that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been cleaned in a while then through mobile phase. So algae will grow in these bottles. And over time, you can end up with this pretty nasty film that can be pretty difficult to remove from your TV. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s just easier to replace the tubing. So when you\u0026rsquo;re going into your LC system, make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not just refilling the bottle, it\u0026rsquo;s okay to do for sure, if you\u0026rsquo;re just in between runs. But we don\u0026rsquo;t want the same bottle on top of your LC for weeks and weeks and weeks, you\u0026rsquo;re just inviting sort of the growth of some algae, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be a pain for you to get rid of. And the next thing that I always kind of recommend doing is going ahead and purging your instrument when you get in the morning. When you\u0026rsquo;re building your batch, it\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do. And this just ensures that there are no bubbles that have been sort of left behind when it was sitting overnight. And only takes a few minutes and just gives you the best data quality you can. And finally, the last thing from sort of an maintenance or preventative maintenance standpoint that you can do is every once in awhile, go ahead and switch your Mobile phase a line and your mobile phase b line. So put your mobile phase a line in the organic and you\u0026rsquo;ll be in the aqueous and just purge your system. And the reason to do this is there can be built up the salts etc. in your pumps, and water usually does a much better job of getting rid of these salts than organic. So purchase system and then go ahead and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to put it back. I\u0026rsquo;ve done that your data will look quite bizarre if you forget to just switch but switch them back and then purge again. So just the easy thing to do every few months to ensure there\u0026rsquo;s no buildup of salts in your pump. So another thing we can check out is our mobile phases themselves. So this is actually from some data from a project that myself and a colleague are working on and the group is looking at solvent purity They\u0026rsquo;re doing some semiconductor analysis. And essentially, they need the solvents to be as pure as possible. So they asked us to dry down a few solvents, and see what impurities we could find. So here in the pink, I have an HPLC grade versus in the blue, I have an CMS grid. And what you\u0026rsquo;ll probably immediately notice is there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things in that HPLC grade. Grated, this is blown down, so it\u0026rsquo;s concentrated. But still, all of these components analytes features would make their way into our mass spectrometer, and essentially, over time, dirtied up our mass spectrometer. So we want to eliminate them as much as possible. So using high grade solvents is an easy way to do that. Another thing is to make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re using high grade modifiers as well. So when it comes to our formic acid, ammonium acetate, etc, that we\u0026rsquo;re using LCMS grade modifiers, just to ensure that our system stays as clean as possible. If we think about how we inject dirty samples, right? Well, we\u0026rsquo;re only injecting a few microliters most of the time compared to our mobile phase, which might be at 0.6 mils per minute for 10 minutes, for hours. So if there\u0026rsquo;s a ton of things in our mobile phase, that\u0026rsquo;s going to really contaminate our system pretty fast. So let\u0026rsquo;s try to avoid it. And that will just end up with more uptime.\nSlide #  [11:23] So, from an LSP perspective, one thing I can\u0026rsquo;t stress enough that I\u0026rsquo;ve been guilty of is make sure that you do regular maintenance. schedule it. Personally, I find it easiest to do once a year when you do your mass spec PM. So when your engineer comes out, or if you do your PM, your maintenance yourself, do your LC maintenance as well. These instruments are operating at high pressures, they\u0026rsquo;re moving constantly, we have pistons, we have rotors, we have a lot of moving parts that just get worn up over time and need to be replaced. So it\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to overlook. But it\u0026rsquo;s really important thing to keep in the back of your mind and to kind of schedule for. So in my opinion, doing it once a year is pretty easy to schedule for it because you just do it at the same time to do your maths back again.\nAnd then something to do when you kind of get into the lab, something to notice that I\u0026rsquo;ve been guilty of is checking for crimped lines, especially if you have a column of and where the line sits sort of outside the column of and a little bit. It can be really easy to shut your peak line in that column oven and you end up with a level crimp. And you\u0026rsquo;ll kind of see an increase in pressure. So anywhere that you\u0026rsquo;re constantly or frequently. Connecting, disconnecting tubing is a good place just to inspect before you run your first sample and say hey, did I accidentally shut my line in my column oven, for example.\nAnd finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about how to use this. But having a system suitability test is really important. And this can vary depending on the type of lab you are really all assessment suitability test is, is a known method where you can compare current results to previous results. So let\u0026rsquo;s say your mass spec has a lifespan of 10 years, over those 10 years, it\u0026rsquo;s a method that you\u0026rsquo;ve run frequently. So you can say, hey, you know, over the past month, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost a quarter my sensitivity, etc. So this could be just the analysis you\u0026rsquo;re doing or the essay you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Or in our case, here at Saks, we just use the pharmaceutical mix, that\u0026rsquo;s very simple and stable. Can we go ahead and check that periodically? About once a month, and just keep an eye on our instrument to make sure if we do notice those drops in sensitivity, we can plan for some downtime.\nSlide #  [13:43] And last but not least, when it comes to maintenance, there\u0026rsquo;s also some computer maintenance. Without our computer, we can\u0026rsquo;t run our LC, we can\u0026rsquo;t run our mass spec, we can\u0026rsquo;t analyze our data. It\u0026rsquo;s a really key portion of the system. So just a few tips for making sure that you kind of eliminate as much downtime as possible. Number one, well, first of all, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re backing up your data, I can\u0026rsquo;t stress that enough. The best place to backup your data would be some sort of network drive, or somewhere electronically. So in the cloud, for example, you can use a hard drive, but just remember that hard drives can fail. So if that\u0026rsquo;s the route you want to go, having a backup of your backup is important. You worked really hard for that data. And you want to make sure that you have access to it when you might need it in the future. The next thing you can do in terms of preventive maintenance is keep those file sizes down. Speaking from a science perspective, when we saved data, we saved them in a data file, that\u0026rsquo;s called a wiff file within that wiff file are all the samples. So you can think of it almost like as a batch. So within a single file, there might be 30 110 samples. But what you want to avoid is, let\u0026rsquo;s say, saving all your samples for the month in that same file and enable the 10 gigabyte file, it\u0026rsquo;s just going to slow your software down, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be difficult to move around. It can be a real pain when it comes to sort of maneuvering these giant data files. So typically, if you\u0026rsquo;re under a gigabyte, you\u0026rsquo;re usually in really good shape.\nThe next thing that you can do is scheduling your antivirus and your Windows updates when you\u0026rsquo;re not acquiring data, so having an antivirus, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re connected to the network is probably a requirement for your IT department. And it\u0026rsquo;s not a bad idea. But we want to make sure that when it\u0026rsquo;s scanning our files, that we\u0026rsquo;re not actively acquiring data that can run into issues with data quality, create gaps in our data. So we don\u0026rsquo;t want that same thing with Windows updates, we certainly don\u0026rsquo;t want our computer to restart in the middle of an important run.\nAnd last but not least from a maintenance standpoint, disk defragmentation is important. It\u0026rsquo;s just a way of making all the space in your computer usable and efficiently usable. So again, once a year, once every couple of months when you\u0026rsquo;re doing that LLC maintenance, when you\u0026rsquo;re doing your mass spec maintenance, go ahead and let the disk defragmenter run. So if you type in your little search bar down on the bottom of your screen, this defrag will pop up and you could just let it run, it might take quite a while if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done it. So I\u0026rsquo;d recommend doing that overnight or something like that.\nSlide: 7 best ways to break your LC-MS/MS system #  [16:35] All right, so let\u0026rsquo;s get into some of the fun things. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got some examples of some issues. And I took a second and thought about some of the most efficient ways you can break your mass spectrometer. So after all the years on the tech support team and dealing with customers, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some pretty creative ways. I\u0026rsquo;ve done some pretty creative things. So here\u0026rsquo;s my list of the top seven ways to break your mass spec.\n) Not using divert valve, we talked about that. But another interesting one, or really effective one would be using improper buffers, or injecting samples with a lot of salts. So a long time ago, I was working in a lab at a university. And at that university, we had a bunch of HPLCs and just one LCMS in the corner. And the HPLCs were pretty much running all the time just doing UV analysis. And we had a new undergraduate that we had hired in. And they had just started and it was a Friday night. And they didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to make new mobile phase for the LCMS. We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there. And they\u0026rsquo;re so new that they didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that the mobile phase from the HPLC V system was not the same as the mobile phase from the LCMS system. So they just went ahead, took that bottle, put it on the LCMS and submitted the run for over the weekend. And unfortunately, that mobile phase had a ton of mass spec incompatible buffers in it. And it also had a really high concentration salts. And when we got back in the morning, Monday morning, after a long weekend of running, there was quite a big buildup of salt on the mass spec. And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of already corrosion occurring. And we ended up having to replace a ton of the front end to get the system operational again, so an easy mistake. But when you\u0026rsquo;re building your methods, when you\u0026rsquo;re going through literature, when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to really nail down that chromatography, make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re using LCMS compatible buffers. ) Another really common thing that I see is starting at a really high flow rate of aqueous. So just really high flow rate of water and having a source temperature that\u0026rsquo;s just a little too low. So what\u0026rsquo;s happening is you\u0026rsquo;re essentially not getting that evaporation, and there\u0026rsquo;s just water running down your curtain plate. Eventually, that water will run down into your source exhaust and clog resource exhaust. And I\u0026rsquo;ve seen sources flood that way. So you want to make sure when you\u0026rsquo;re building your methods, that you\u0026rsquo;re using a temperature that\u0026rsquo;s appropriate to get your evaporation. And if not that you\u0026rsquo;re at least using that divert valve. So it\u0026rsquo;s not going to your mass spec, it\u0026rsquo;s going to waste when it\u0026rsquo;s more that high or or high aqueous content.\nSlide #  But let\u0026rsquo;s get into some of the problems. So we come into lab, there\u0026rsquo;s issues when there\u0026rsquo;s one issue, there\u0026rsquo;s many issues, what do we do? And anytime we do any troubleshooting, we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to try to isolate the issue. So figure out what where\u0026rsquo;s the issue coming from? Is it an LC issue? Is it a mass spec issue? The next thing we want to do is designate some key read backs or essentially key variables that we can use to assess the problem whether it\u0026rsquo;s getting better or worse. This might be intensity. This could be my pressure but it could be just the overall vacuum pressure, for example. So we want to have this sort of key Rebeck that we\u0026rsquo;ll use to assess whether we\u0026rsquo;re fixing the problem, or the problem is getting worse.\nAnd then we want to have some tools. So just two quick examples of tools. But system suitability test is a really great tool for your LC. And then when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the mass spec, right, we want to isolate the mass spec. So usually, we\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some sort of infusion.\nSlide: Case #01 #  So let\u0026rsquo;s start out with an extremely common, but pretty easy problem to fix when you get into the lab. And there\u0026rsquo;s a red light on our mass spec. So we go into our software, and we notice there\u0026rsquo;s some some errors here.\nSo the first thing we want to do is say, All right, so the mass spec has an error. Is there something obvious? Did I forget to put the source on? Maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the source correctly? Are there any error messages that can give me some clues, and also just the vacuum pressure look reasonable?\nSo you\u0026rsquo;ll notice the vacuum is quote, not okay. So status, not okay, that\u0026rsquo;s not a good, it\u0026rsquo;s not a good status. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to try to figure out why that is occurring. Right. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to start at the roughing pump. is the roughing pump on? If so we can move on, why isn\u0026rsquo;t the mass spec pumping down? The most common thing I\u0026rsquo;ve seen for this is a faulty gas generator. So your mass spec will not pump down to a certain state until that mass spec knows it has nitrogen in there. So if your generator your gas generators off, or there\u0026rsquo;s some error with it, maybe the flow rate is just way too low, your mass spec won\u0026rsquo;t even try to pump down. So check your gas generator, if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, turn back on your gas generator or increase that pressure. And then we\u0026rsquo;re just going to power cycle or an aspect. Since it\u0026rsquo;s in this case, not bent, or it\u0026rsquo;s completely vented, we can just go ahead and hit that power switch. But if it was not, we want to make sure that we hit that little button and slow down that turbo. And if none of those things work, well, then we\u0026rsquo;re probably going to have to put in a service call.\nSlide: Case #02 #  Another sort of really common, but pretty fixable and pretty easily fixable problem with just the general software issues. Again, that computers incredibly important. That\u0026rsquo;s how we control our instrument. It\u0026rsquo;s how we control the LC. But there can be communication errors. And I\u0026rsquo;d say over the years, communication errors end up being the problems you\u0026rsquo;ll see a at least 80%. I think that\u0026rsquo;s been a little conservative. But luckily, they\u0026rsquo;re really easy to fix. So one of the things you can do is just isolate what is the problem is the mass spec not connecting? Or is it the LC. And if it\u0026rsquo;s the say, in this case, it\u0026rsquo;s the LC, the next step would just do a power cycle. So shutting down your software, closing the services. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the services, just go ahead and restarting your computer. And while you\u0026rsquo;re doing that, going through just turning the power switch off on your pumps, your auto sampler column oven, your entire LC stack, and leaving it off I typically when I turn off a power switch for a mass spec or an LC, I like to wait 10 minutes before switching it back on again. And when I do switch it back on again, I\u0026rsquo;m going to wait another minute or so before it tried to connect to it with the software. A lot of times, for example, your auto sampler might do some initialization where it\u0026rsquo;s trying to home the needle, make sure everything\u0026rsquo;s working properly. And I don\u0026rsquo;t want to interrupt it while it\u0026rsquo;s doing that. So just restarting, doing a power switch or power cycle is usually enough to sort of fix these more common issues.\nSlide: Case #03 Shifting retention times example 1 #  [23:55] Let\u0026rsquo;s move into some exciting sort of not as common issues. So here we have an example of peeks that are just alluding earlier and earlier. So we pretty confident this is an LC issue, right? There\u0026rsquo;s not really anything from a mass perception perspective that could cause this to happen. So let\u0026rsquo;s say we run our system suitability test and everything looks fine. Or maybe everything doesn\u0026rsquo;t look fine. We can use that information to kind of decide which variable might be wrong or what issue we\u0026rsquo;re having.\nPotential causes\nSo some of the reasons this could be occurring would be there\u0026rsquo;s an issue with your pump. So maybe one of your pumps isn\u0026rsquo;t pumping efficiently. Maybe there\u0026rsquo;s air in the line, but more likely, your column isn\u0026rsquo;t equilibrated enough. So we talked about it in the method development section quite a bit, but we need that column to be equilibrated to the starting conditions. So we want that column at the starting conditions and the same starting conditions for every injection. So if you maybe shortened your method a little bit, eliminated have some of that set, that a calibration step, this could be an issue you\u0026rsquo;re having, or just if this is the method you\u0026rsquo;re building and you\u0026rsquo;re receiving this. So it\u0026rsquo;s a really easy problem to fix, all we need to do is on our gradient, add a little bit more time to that equilibration step. So when we come back down from that high organic to our starting conditions, add a minute or two, if you want, you can calculate exactly how much time you need to add, typically, three column volumes is enough to equilibrate your column. But if not, add 30 seconds to a minute, and see if this problem persists.\nSlide: Case #03 Shifting retention times example 2 #  So now another issue with retention time would be just your peaks moving all around. So this is something that\u0026rsquo;s happened to me a bunch, where you just see one injection, you know, your retention time is seven and a quarter, and then you inject immediately after that. And now it\u0026rsquo;s eight minutes, and it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of bouncing around randomly. So this can be a pretty frustrating problem, especially if you have retention on Windows. And these shifts caused them to be outside those windows, so essentially not seeing that peek.\nPotential causes\nMore likely than not, this is just caused by some air in your lines. So we talked about purging, I always like to purge in the morning, it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to do. Just go ahead purge your A line and your B line and your rinse line, if you have one and take the two minutes and eliminate this problem. That being said, if that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fix your issue, there are a couple places that air can kind of hide in your LC system. And the most common one I see is the solvent filters. So that little filter on the bottom of your Eluant line that\u0026rsquo;s in your bottle. A lot of times they\u0026rsquo;re metal, sometimes if they\u0026rsquo;re brand new air can kind of get stuck in there. And it can be pretty difficult to remove. So if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, you can go ahead and take them off, put them in methanol or your mobile phase itself, and just sonicator them quickly. And that will get rid of a lot of the air, you put them right back on, and you should be good to go.\nSlide: Case #03 Shifting retention times example 3 #  But let\u0026rsquo;s say that is happening. So you know, Monday morning, we come in, and we\u0026rsquo;ve got this nice peak, it\u0026rsquo;s elluting right in our retention time window, and then all of a sudden on Tuesday, we don\u0026rsquo;t see that peak anymore. So the first thing we need to figure out is, is this a mass spec issue? So has their sensitivity somehow completely disappeared, and we just can\u0026rsquo;t see that peak? Or is it an LC issue? is that peak eluting outside of our retention time window? So typically, the easiest way to sort of address this, would be to go ahead and run an unscheduled method. So if you remember from the method development section, when we talk about scheduled methods, we\u0026rsquo;re telling the instrument, hey, look for this peak at this retention time, versus an unscheduled method where it\u0026rsquo;s constantly looking for that peak. Now, if you have a lot of analytes, the data quality might not be great. But you can go ahead and unscheduled, just the peak that you have an issue with or just unscheduled them all. We\u0026rsquo;re not using this for quantitation. We\u0026rsquo;re not super worried. If there\u0026rsquo;s only three or four points across our peak at this point, we just want to know is that peak eluting? Or is there another issue that would be more mass spec related. And if we do see a peak, there are a few things we can do to try to address this. So let\u0026rsquo;s say our peak is just outside a retention window.\nPotential causes\nthe easiest thing to do would be to make some new mobile phase, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ve let our mobile phase sit for quite a while. We\u0026rsquo;re using formic acid, it\u0026rsquo;s volatile, and it\u0026rsquo;s sat too long. And now we have this retention time shift.\nAnother really easy thing to do would just be to try a new batch of buffer. So let\u0026rsquo;s say again, we\u0026rsquo;re using formic acid, maybe that formic acid super old, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s been left out on the counter overnight without a cap. Maybe the quality of it just isn\u0026rsquo;t very good. Try a new batch is usually a really easy solution to see, hey, does that help.\nAnd then finally, just trying a new column see if that column has sort of run it\u0026rsquo;s life. And maybe a new one will address this problem. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that a lot of the LC and retention time issues in particular, often can be attributed to columns. So the easiest thing or the best thing, I think, in my opinion is to go ahead, purchase an extra column, keep it in your drawer, even if you\u0026rsquo;re not using it. It\u0026rsquo;s a really fast way to assess is it the column or is it the LC? Since that\u0026rsquo;s going to be the area you kind of focus on first.\nSlide: Case #04 High Background #  [29:45] But let\u0026rsquo;s say we have this issue, let\u0026rsquo;s say we have current data and historical data. So the current data in pink and historical data in blue, and if we look at this would say hey, everything looks pretty good. Our peak heights are very similar. I have no issue if this isn\u0026rsquo;t a low point in my career if I might not even notice what\u0026rsquo;s going on. But if we zoom in to our background, what we see is, there\u0026rsquo;s been a really big increase in our background. So we\u0026rsquo;re starting to see a lot of background, about 1500 CPS, compared to our traditional background, which was around 100 CPS, so a 15x increase in background. Now, this might not be a problem right away. Maybe if this is the low point of our curve, it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem for a long time. But if it\u0026rsquo;s not, and we wanted to sort of go a bit lower or take a look at sort of our true LOD on a system, we\u0026rsquo;d likely have a pretty hard time. Because in the past, if our peak was 1500, CPSI, for example, that\u0026rsquo;s a well defined peak from our background, based on historical data. But in our current data set, you would not really notice that peak was there. So you could lose that information. And we don\u0026rsquo;t want that.\nPotential causes\nSo some of the things that can be causing this, it could be your column again, so you could have some kind of aging, contamination,\nthe mobile phases is probably a really good place to start. So try a new batch of mobile phase, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re washing your bottles three times before you do it. And then let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;re using one vendor for your aqueous, try another vendors, see if that helps, see if that removes some of your background. And if it does, great. If not, then you can go after maybe the column or the buffer solution. But typically, when we see this, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be mobile phase related.\nSlide: Case #05 Peak Shape Deterioration #  Another issue that we run into quite a bit would be we had really great peak symmetry, everything was looking great. And now we have tailing, perhaps, or we even have fronting. So what can be causing that?\nPotential causes\nAgain, it could be a column issue. Another thing that can occur is if you\u0026rsquo;ve changed your sample composition, so let\u0026rsquo;s say in your earlier method, you were injecting 50%, water, 50% methanol, and now you\u0026rsquo;ve increased it to 60% methanol or 70% methanol, that can have a big effect on your peak shape. So that could be a cause.\nBut if nothing\u0026rsquo;s changed, the most likely culprit is just a leak. So recheck your fittings, go ahead and make sure that your confidence are tight and secure, you don\u0026rsquo;t have a leak anywhere, these leaks would be really hard to find they\u0026rsquo;re likely very, very small. So what I would typically do is just disconnect the column completely, and then reconnect it again, make sure that the fittings aren\u0026rsquo;t, for example, damaged in some way.\nSlide: Case #06 Quantification #  [32:48] Number six. So here we have a quantification issue. And this is one that we see a lot at Sciex, and it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s just a silly one that we can fix really quickly. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got this beautiful curve, we\u0026rsquo;re very happy with it. And then we end up when we go to our next data file the next day. But this degenerative curve, so we see, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s just a straight line, and not linear in the way we want. It\u0026rsquo;s just perfectly horizontal. So what could be causing that we take a look at our peak areas, and we say, hey, our areas look good. Our internal standard areas look good, they\u0026rsquo;re consistent. Why is this occurring? And more than likely, in fact, almost definitely, what happened is you may have accidentally entered in concentrations for your internal standard concentration. So typically, when we use an internal standard, as we discussed last time, they\u0026rsquo;re added at the same amount. Whereas here, accidentally, you\u0026rsquo;ve entered them in as if they were occurring themselves. So when we\u0026rsquo;re doing that ratio, if you remember from last time, we\u0026rsquo;re we\u0026rsquo;re taking the area of the internal standard over the area of your analyte. We\u0026rsquo;re ending up with this perfectly horizontal line. In our software, for example, there\u0026rsquo;s an option to apply concentrations to all and if you don\u0026rsquo;t have your internal standards listed as internal standards, when you do this, it\u0026rsquo;s going to apply just your standard concentrations. Super easy fix though, all you\u0026rsquo;ve got to do is go into your software and enter the true concentration of an internal standard. But I figured I\u0026rsquo;d mention it because I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it a lot. And it\u0026rsquo;s just an easy thing to happen. But it might not be super obvious the first time it happens to you.\nSlide: Case #06 Quantification #  [34:38] Here\u0026rsquo;s a scenario where we have a linear curve, everything\u0026rsquo;s looking great. But over time a curve becomes nonlinear. In this case, it\u0026rsquo;s more quadratic.\nPotential Causes\nSo what could be causing this? And that can be a few different things. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna depend a little bit based on how you built your method and when you build your method. One of the times I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this or several of the times a few of the times I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this have been when a method was built on an instrument that wasn\u0026rsquo;t operating at its full sensitivity. So let\u0026rsquo;s say, you know, your instrument was sort of dirty, or maybe it was your detector wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully optimized correctly. So your sensitivity wasn\u0026rsquo;t as great as it could have been. So when you built your curve, initially, it was linear. And then your engineer yourself, went in, optimized, clean, etc. And now you\u0026rsquo;re seeing this quadratic curve. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case, there\u0026rsquo;s no big issue, we can just adjust the method to sort of account for this. And the easiest way to account for this, regardless of the cause would be to go ahead and either inject less. That way, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to change any of your sample preparation procedures, or your SOP or anything like that. And the other option would be just to use a slightly less concentrated solution. So you can decrease your your upper LOQ, will depend a little bit based on kind of your goals and what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to accomplish which way you choose. But you have a couple of options there to sort of eliminate this issue.\nSlide: Case #07 Low Sensitivity #  And then the classic one, low sensitivity. So this is very clearly a mass spec problem. We\u0026rsquo;ve determined the LC is operating completely, normally, we\u0026rsquo;ve tried new mobile phase, etc, we can isolate it to our mass spec.\nPotential Causes\nAnd the easiest way to do this is with an infusion. So we can take a tuning solution, so one of the ones provided with your instrument, or we can simply use a compound that we know the relative sensitivity what it should be, and infuse it. And if we noticed that, hey, there is this drop off in sensitivity. It\u0026rsquo;s simply not as sensitive as it used to be. The most likely culprit is just a dirty mess spec. And that could be your probe, that could be your curtain plate, that could be your Q-jet. Hopefully not too much further than that. So the easiest thing to do would be to go ahead and clean. if you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable doing the front end cleaning. So meaning that you\u0026rsquo;ve removed your curtain plate or orifice plate, you\u0026rsquo;ve taken out your cue check, you can do that. So typically, when I go ahead and clean a Q-jet, I\u0026rsquo;ll go ahead and take it out, put it in a beaker of water, sonicated for 10 or so minutes, then put it in a beaker of methanol sonicated for 10 or so minutes before putting it back in. That\u0026rsquo;s a really easy, quick way to sort of clean your Q-jet. If it\u0026rsquo;s just a little bit dirty. If it\u0026rsquo;s more dirty than that, you might have to do a little bit of disassembly. Or if you\u0026rsquo;re uncomfortable doing those types of front end cleanings, you can go ahead and just schedule a service call. And they can get it sorted for you pretty quickly. But having that sort of tool, that infusion tool and a known solution, whether it be your tuning solution is really key here, because that\u0026rsquo;s going to identify that yes, the problem was the mess back. And more than likely, it just needs to clean.\nSlide: Case #08 HPLC Clog #  [38:10] What about clogs, we see them all the time, especially for dealing with some nasty samples. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got this higher pressure than we\u0026rsquo;d expect. Where maybe our pumps are maxing out and stopping. Because the pressure is so high. How do we address this.\nPotential Causes\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s likely a clog. The easiest way to sort of address and troubleshoot a clog would be to go through and systematically remove pieces of tubing. Usually, you\u0026rsquo;d want to start at the mass spec, remove the probe has the pressure gone down, remove the piece of tubing from the diverter valve to the probe has the pressure gone down, and so on so forth, and just move your way up the line. And as you move your way up the line, eventually when you remove a piece of tubing, that pressure will drop. And when it does, you\u0026rsquo;ve isolated the problem, you can go ahead and replace that piece of tubing and see if your pressure is in a normal range or if there\u0026rsquo;s more tubing that needs replaced.\nSlide: Case #09 Missing data #  [39:07] But pretty simple. Compared to something like missing data, so missing data is one of the more frustrating things you\u0026rsquo;ve submitted around, everything looks good. And they come in and you see, hey, there\u0026rsquo;s only this electrical noise. So there\u0026rsquo;s no background, there\u0026rsquo;s no peak. If I look at my background, previously, there was sort of this around 5500 CPS background and now there\u0026rsquo;s just nothing.\nPotential Causes I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely been here before. And when it\u0026rsquo;s a new method, I may have forgotten to program my Diverter Valve properly. So instead of going to my mass spec, it was always going to my waist. But if it\u0026rsquo;s not a new method and nothing has changed, you\u0026rsquo;d likely have a leak. More than likely it\u0026rsquo;s probably in your column oven. So go ahead, pop up in the column oven, ensure all your fittings are tight. Check your source make sure that you\u0026rsquo;ve got added that piece of tubing to your actual probe. But more than likely, there\u0026rsquo;s a leak somewhere if all of a sudden you see this issue after switching columns, for example.\nSlide: Case #10 carryover from flow path #  And for number 10. So this is actually one that was requested. Last time we asked some of the questions. And this was about carryover. So we had run a high standard, and now we\u0026rsquo;ve run a blank, and we have some carryover that we need to address. Well, there are two main sources for carryover and they present pretty differently. If it\u0026rsquo;s coming from the autosampler, like in this case, where we have just some consistent contact with the standard and our autosampler Needle, what we\u0026rsquo;ll see in our sample is just this continuous peak. So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how much we inject, the peak is always the same. So if we go ahead and inject 10 microliters, our peak and our blank is going to be the same height. If we inject 20 microliters, the peak in our blank is still the same height. So that\u0026rsquo;s telling us that it\u0026rsquo;s just from contact, a couple of ways to address this would be go ahead and inject less or reduce your standard concentration volume.\nAnother option is if you\u0026rsquo;ve set your protrusion depth very deep, you can back that off a little bit. So go up a little bit and make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not completely submerging the needle, that can sometimes help as well.\nSlide: Case #10 carryover from column #  [41:23] If that\u0026rsquo;s not the case, and that contamination is coming from your column, well, then there\u0026rsquo;s another solution for you. And the easiest way to kind of determine between the two are to try to figure out whether it\u0026rsquo;s from your column, or it\u0026rsquo;s from your injector, is to do these repeated gradients. So this is a single run, where I\u0026rsquo;ve done the same gradient four times. So what I see is that I have a contamination and run to it\u0026rsquo;s still there, it\u0026rsquo;s decreasing over time. But that contamination is still present. So what this is telling me is that it\u0026rsquo;s not from the auto sampler, because my auto sampler isn\u0026rsquo;t doing anything. So it hasn\u0026rsquo;t injected anything. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t it\u0026rsquo;s valves haven\u0026rsquo;t changed, it\u0026rsquo;s just been sitting idle. And instead, we\u0026rsquo;re just flowing through right through a column. So likely this is a column. More than likely, it\u0026rsquo;s maybe we don\u0026rsquo;t have an long enough whole time for organic. So we talked about sort of that column equilibration time here, just increasing that column whole time or that organic hold time, may help. So again, typically three column volumes. But if we increase that a minute or two, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll see this determination decrease. The other option, obviously, is trying another column.\nSlide: Case #11 Contamination #  And last but not least, this is one of my favorite sort of case studies that happened to us. So this is contamination, contamination is a big issue. In in all labs, right, we\u0026rsquo;re worried about it. And in this lab in particular, and they\u0026rsquo;re blanks, they\u0026rsquo;re having a contamination issue, we determined it wasn\u0026rsquo;t carryover, we tried running a new blank. That didn\u0026rsquo;t work, we tried to different methanol source, like before it maybe it\u0026rsquo;s coming from our mobile phase, that also didn\u0026rsquo;t work. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen dirty pipettes cause things like this. So we just removed the pipette completely or tried a different pipette. And that was the case. And then finally, we just tried a new column. Again, we\u0026rsquo;re still seeing this background peek. So maybe it\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s just contaminated our LC, and we need to flush out so we flushed the system for a few hours with methanol and formic acid. And we saw no decrease in this peak height. So then we started thinking, Well, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not from our mass spec, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s from our surroundings, right? So we\u0026rsquo;ve kind of figured out that it\u0026rsquo;s not really from the LC system, it\u0026rsquo;s really not mass spec related. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like it\u0026rsquo;s a file, sample prep, etc. What about our environment. So we went around swabbing, which is taking a chem wipe with a little bit of methanol on it, it\u0026rsquo;s swabbing different surfaces around the lab. And in the prep room, the peak was a little bigger, but it was pretty much the same. outside the lab, we noticed, okay, not a whole ton of difference. And then compared to our blank, really, we\u0026rsquo;re just seeing the same thing. So we haven\u0026rsquo;t really identified the source yet. But talking to the customer, and they mentioned that they had a new air conditioner installed in that lab about a month ago. And, you know, we kind of started thinking, we\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly when this problem started. So we went ahead and swapped that air conditioner, and got a big peak for this compound. So what had happened where they\u0026rsquo;re using some similar compound wasn\u0026rsquo;t the exact same compound, but it was sharing an MRM transition and causing this really high background peak that was causing them not to be able to run that assay. So when we figured this out, we took the AC out of the room. They ended up cleaning it and reassembling it and their background went back down. But it\u0026rsquo;s something to think about when we think about contamination, it maybe from the LLC, and maybe even mass spec, but we also have to remember that it could also be from the environment. [Note] Visualization would be a big tool to catch the date when it happened.\nSlide #  Regardless, in all these cases, troubleshooting is an important part of what we do day to day. And the one thing I\u0026rsquo;ll say is, the more practice you get with troubleshooting, the better you become. So if you\u0026rsquo;re a scientist who\u0026rsquo;s just starting out, Shadow your senior scientist, because they\u0026rsquo;ve probably seen the same scenario before, and they can help you get to the bottom of the problem a little bit faster. And if your senior scientist in includes some of those more junior scientists into your, into your troubleshooting process, it\u0026rsquo;s going to help them out and it\u0026rsquo;s going to help you out in the long run when you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fix their problems as much. Regardless, though, it\u0026rsquo;s all about isolation. So isolate where the problem is, is it a mass spec problem, computer problem, LC problem is it my environment, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be really critical for getting to the bottom of your problem as quickly as possible.\nSlide #  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in more of the maintenance courses, say you really want to learn how to do a front end cleaning, I encourage you to check out sites now they have great videos that go through step by step from removing the Q-jet, disassembling it, cleaning the lens, all of that can be found here. So go ahead, sign up. Those courses, I believe are free. So they can be a really great resource.\nAnd with that, I just want to remind you that you can check out any of these videos on demand and continue to watch this series. And let us know in the future kind of some of the things you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, because we really want to provide you with tools and solutions for the problems that you\u0026rsquo;re facing in your lab.\nQ\u0026amp;A #  Thank you for that insightful presentation, curl around maintenance and troubleshooting. I hope you learned a couple of tips and tricks to keep your system in tip top shape. And now we\u0026rsquo;ll open the floor for questions.\nQ#1\nSo the first question is around the probe. So you mentioned Karl, the need for cleaning the probe on the ion source? Can you Sonicate the entire probe? And if that\u0026rsquo;s not the cleaning mechanism, what do you recommend as far as a cleaning protocol for your ion source probe? Yeah, great question. So you can suffocate the entire probe, or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it. But what you can do is take out that electrode. So when you check your protrusion, right, that electrode that sticks out at the bottom of your probe, you can remove that and sonicated that completely. So that\u0026rsquo;s okay to be completely submerged. If you wanted to, you could clean the housing of your pro, but it really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t affect with like clogs, or anything like that, since your fluid is going through that electrode, right. So I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about it. Usually, you can just clean the probe with the kim wipe, and just wipe it down quickly.\nQ#2\nExcellent. Okay, on to the next question, which is about cleaning mobile phase bottle. So you mentioned a few times that somebody should clean their mobile phase bottles, what solvents, or solution mixtures should be used to clean the mobile phase bottles for the LC system?\nYeah, great question. So some sort of organic is typically sufficient. So something like I see aectonitrile, and methanol, the big thing we want to do is make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re washing them multiple times. So when we go ahead and clean with methanol, for example, we\u0026rsquo;re going to rinse once dispose of that solution, rinse again with methanol, dispose of that solution, and so on, so forth. Some labs do use something like alconox or other class where cleaners, I\u0026rsquo;ve always kind of steered away from that a little bit, because it can cause issues if you don\u0026rsquo;t organize them properly. So if you have a really, really dirty mobile phase bottle, maybe maybe you need to do that. But most of the time, these mobile phase bottles, right, they\u0026rsquo;re relatively clean. So triple rinsing was something like methanol or acetonitrile is usually is sufficient.\nQ#3\nExcellent. Next question was around mobile phase filtration. You didn\u0026rsquo;t mention mobile phase filtration, do you feel the need to filter your mobile phases? And if so why?\nYeah, great question. So no, I really never do any mobile phase filtration. In general, I typically find that that adds more contaminants than it removes, at least in my case. Instead, what I always recommend is purchasing those high grade solvents, those LCMS grade solvents, because that\u0026rsquo;s essentially what the solvent vendor has done. It\u0026rsquo;s filter it and they have very specific procedures and QA QC requirements for that solvent. So they just do a better job than me so I don\u0026rsquo;t do it in house. I purchase it from them.\nQ#4\nExcellent. The next question is around system suitability. You talked about the need for system suitability mixes. do you have any suggestions for test compounds that you might want to put into mixes? And and if not, maybe a strategy for how based on their application or need, they might select a system suitability mix?\nYeah. So one of the easiest ways to selected selected system suitability mix is if you have an instrument, let\u0026rsquo;s say your mass spec is constantly running pesticides. That\u0026rsquo;s really all it does. is it runs this pesticide mix, well, then you have a great historical data of what you know what that mix looks like over time. So that kind of is your system suitability next. The other option if that\u0026rsquo;s not the case, so let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;re maybe an acedamic lab, or maybe this mass spec is being used for multiple different assays, choosing something really simple like [???] if you\u0026rsquo;re looking at positive mode or a vertical, if it\u0026rsquo;s negative mode, something that is really accessible. And ionization really well is usually what I would suggest, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need a ton of different compounds. Just having the single compound can give you a lot of information.\nQ#5\nExcellent. Okay. The next question is around mobile phase flow rates. What mobile phase flow rate is too high? Because you talked about too high and flooding the source? How do you determine what is too high?\nYeah, so it\u0026rsquo;s going to depend based on your source temperature. So if you\u0026rsquo;re running at a very low source temperature, let\u0026rsquo;s say 300 mils per minute, or I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, 300 degrees Celsius. And then you have a flow rate of A mil per minute, and you\u0026rsquo;re pumping just completely aqueous solvent, it\u0026rsquo;s probably going to not evaporate and just continue to reach your curtain plate. Versus if it was a mil per minute and was methanol, it would have every little bit easier, right? So there\u0026rsquo;s a little couple of variables at play. Typically, though, based on our analytical columns that we use for LCMS, I don\u0026rsquo;t see flow rates really ever above 1.2 mils, and that\u0026rsquo;s very, very high. Usually, one mil is about the target and range for flow rates.\nQ#6\nExcellent. Okay. The next question is around blank injections. Do you recommend a blank injection at the end of your batch? And where else do you recommend running blank injections throughout your batch for maximum data quality?\nAbsolutely. So certainly, I\u0026rsquo;d say the most important place to run a blank is after your highest standard. So you\u0026rsquo;ve run your curve, then go ahead and run a blank and see if you have any carryover there. The other thing I like to do, and I think we talked about it last time, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of sandwich my samples. So I\u0026rsquo;ll run, let\u0026rsquo;s say 10 samples, run a QC and then run a blank. So that Qc is going to go ahead and tell me my calibration period still great. But the blank is going to let me know if I have carryover issues. Maybe I ran a really hot sample, and I\u0026rsquo;m still seeing some caffeine in my next run. So running them sort of in that sandwich, maybe every 10 to 20 samples is usually a good range to ensure your data quality is very high.\nQ#7\nExcellent. And the next question is also around solvents. It\u0026rsquo;s using DMSO, as far as a solvent for the sample itself, not as far as mobile phases. Do you recommend using the DMSO as a solvent for the samples? Or do you recommend maybe drying down and reconstituting in more mass spec friendly solvents for samples?\nIf you can, reconstitution is probably your best bet, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re going to be running a lot of samples. If it\u0026rsquo;s something that you\u0026rsquo;re sort of doing some exploration with, and you\u0026rsquo;re injecting just a small amount, it can be okay, but I really avoid it as much as possible. Typically, you know, I try to shoot my system isn\u0026rsquo;t as nice as I can.\nQ#8\nExcellent. The next question is around multiresidue methods, right? A lot of our customers use the mass spectrometry systems to look at a lot of different analytes in one injection. What\u0026rsquo;s your first line of defense if you only see a problem with maybe one or two of the analyte? And that methodology and not a whole methodology?\nYeah. So that\u0026rsquo;s something that actually happens to us quite a bit in our cannabis method, for example, and customers will say, you know, hey, I\u0026rsquo;m looking for [???]. My [???] sensitivity has really dropped off, but many other analyzer are totally fine. And a lot of times that can be attributed to our modifiers. So if you\u0026rsquo;ve made in this case, they\u0026rsquo;re looking at ammonium anions but only a handful of them are actually ammonium anions. So they only see this like loss of sensitivity with their [???]. So the easiest solution or the solution there is likely that their modifier is just a little old, maybe their their mobile phase is old, so they can just try to remake some new one or or if that\u0026rsquo;s not the case, go ahead, purchase some new ammonium cases ammonium formate some new ammonium formate and try that and see if that works.\nThank you so much for joining us today and for providing those insightful questions. Again, a big thanks to Karl for providing the great presentation around maintenance and troubleshooting. We hope you enjoyed this session of LC Ms. Ms. 101. And we look forward to seeing you at another Sykes event. Have a great day. Stay safe, stay healthy, and we look forward to seeing you soon bye for now\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Others/Workflow_pesticides_spicesNtobacco/","title":"Pesticides in Spices and Tobacco","section":"Other Courses","content":" Spice Up Your Life with MS: Workflows for High Throughput Pesticide Analysis by MS/MS in Challenging Matrices such as Spices and Tobacco\n"},{"id":40,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Others/High_throughput_pesticides/","title":"The Challenges and Workflow Dilemma of High-throughput Multi-residue Pesticide","section":"Other Courses","content":" The Challenges and Workflow Dilemma of High-throughput Multi-residue Pesticide\nHello ladies and gentleman, my name is David hills from separation science. And I\u0026rsquo;d like to welcome you all to our latest webinar in collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific. Our topic today is high throughput multi residue pesticide screening program in a quality control environments, the challenges and workflow solutions. Let me introduce our presenter for today\u0026rsquo;s webinar. Kathy BANA Shecky is a method development supervisor at NOW Foods where she leads the development and validation of analytical methods. Katie has degrees in biotechnology and chemistry from William Paterson University. And prior to joining NOW Foods, she worked at the Institute for Food Safety and Health and Mars Snackfood us. She specializes in mass spectrometry applications and residue analysis. Katie has led the development and implementation of a routine pesticide residue monitoring program at NOW Foods and plays an integral role in growing the company\u0026rsquo;s analytical capabilities. Katie authored and co authored multiple publications and is continuously contributing to the scientific community in the area of research on natural products. And so, without further ado, I\u0026rsquo;ll turn the presentation over to Katie banner Shecky. Katie, thank you, David, for this kind introduction. And of course, for the opportunity to present the work we do up now. For those not familiar with the brand, NOW Foods is a manufacturer of dietary supplements, sports nutrition, personal care items and suits. NOW Foods is one of the top selling brands in the health food stores and online and award winning manufacturer and a leader in the fields of nutritional science and math development. We are continuously growing within the natural products industry. And we\u0026rsquo;re also contributing to the science community in the area of research on natural products. But the growth, the awards and the recognition are the effects of our carefully developed and implemented quality sensor systems. One of the most important aspects of formulating and manufacturing great quality and efficacy supplements is the quality control of the ingredients. So what makes a great botanical ingredient great quality botanical ingredient there\u0026rsquo;s a couple of key components that contribute to the control of botanical ingredient quality, first and foremost, establishing partnerships with dependable quality conscious suppliers. Also implementing good manufacturing practices is important in a reputable manufacturing companies also creating ingredients specifications which would list the plant species part and the potency of the chemicals that that is being claimed. But also testing botanicals for contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides, plays a very very important role in controlling the quality of botanical ingredients. So how does quality control look like at now so we do have a very comprehensive vendor qualification probe program in place, which ensures that we only source the preeminent quality ingredients. We comply with 21 CFR one a lot of cGMP to make sure that the products that we manufacture are made according to the standards, the best standards in the industry. And something that I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely proud of is our world class labs and science teams to make sure that the products are safe from adulteration, contamination and ingredient substitution by implementing a very routine stringent testing program. As we learn the health promoting properties, botanical of botanicals and try to understand the mechanism of action we also learn that the active constituents are not the only ones we must be paying attention to. So besides health promoting components botanicals may contain contaminants such as pesticides which are more and more concerning. If we look at the society and people being more and more conscious about what they\u0026rsquo;re actually consuming, the widespread use of pesticides makes the appearance of the residues in conventional foods expected. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t want any residues present in the organic ingredients and more and more manufacturers as now food get questions regarding pesticide testing and the cleanliness of our ingredients that that are used in the manufacturing process. So the pressure overall from the society on manufacturers of dietary supplements and natural foods is is much stronger. Therefore, the need to develop and validate and implement methods for precise determination of pesticide residues in the ingredients becomes becomes a must. So what is the risk associated with pesticides being present in botanicals? Oh, people consume more dietary supplements than than ever. The nutritional content of consumed Foods has decreased drastically over the past decades. And it has a lot to do with the way POTUS is harvested for transport. So instead of eating a tomato that has low level of beneficial lycopene, it is just so much easier to swallow a capsule that has lycopene already purified concentrated and so much potent. It\u0026rsquo;s easy and it works. And if it improves, people\u0026rsquo;s overall well being, they will reach out for more. So naturally, if a botanical ingredient contains high pesticide residues, the exposure gets much higher. So the increased consumption as I mentioned above dietary supplements, which has become a prominent part of global culture could potentially expose customers to higher levels of pesticides. But also the more and more strict regulations globally, due to strong implications of the negative impact on human and animal health play a big role in in the risk assessment. From a company standpoint, the costs associated with organic ingredients compared to the conventional ingredients also plays a huge role because if we are paying for organic ingredient a premium price, we want to make sure that that ingredient is of the purity that the manufacturer or the vendor is claiming that we\u0026rsquo;re actually paying what we are getting. So to ensure the safety of our botanical ingredients, we have developed in house testing program to monitor the pesticide residues in our botanical ingredients. The program is designed specifically with the focus on botanical matrices. And the method was developed and validated based on the sample document and below is a picture of the team. I call them a pasty team from the last is a shawl Jerry and Aman. Those that group is responsible for running the program up now suits and they\u0026rsquo;re doing a fabulous job. If I was familiar with pesticide analysis and botanical ingredients, the residue analysis and any plant based dried botanical is among the most difficult to perform due to the severe complexity of the matrix. But not only that most dietary supplements and ingredients come in the form of concentrated extracts, which creates an additional challenge because naturally those extracts are so much more concentrated. Thus the matrix and appearance becomes a much heavier also matrix specific sample preparation and sensitive instrumentation are essential in ensuring success in detecting small amounts of residues in complex matrices. What are our challenges? Now foods? We we have about three 100 botanical ingredients that are being used in manufacturing of our products. That is a lot of various botanicals. And if we are thinking about sample preparation, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of various matrices to address. The for the analytical complexity of those botanical matrices complicates the development of a sample preparation that will actually fit all. Also, we\u0026rsquo;re sourcing our materials worldwide, we we need to keep our keep in mind that those ingredients have been exposed to different agricultural practices. Different parts of the world have different treatment allowances, de France, pesticides that are accepted to be used and different residues that are prohibited. So looking at the scope of the pesticides that we\u0026rsquo;re trying to screen for, we have to keep in mind that different regions different areas of the world, may may be exposed to different residues. As I said, the maximum residue limits are pretty well established for fresh produce and other foods. However, if we looked at dietary ingredients and botanical dry botanical materials, they\u0026rsquo;re the resources as far as maximum residue limits are not that well described. Therefore, some commodity in some commodities, interpretation of analytical results is very difficult because we cannot compare fresh produce action limit to a dry botanical action limits. So that\u0026rsquo;s why it is it is sometimes quite difficult to establish those acceptance criteria and botanical matrices. Once we decided to bring that ability and build the pesticide residue testing program in house, we had just a couple of simple goals, we wanted to be able to control the whole process from sample preparation to reporting on the result and have visibility of the of the process in house. As opposed to getting a number from from a contract laboratory. We also needed to customize the sample preparation to address those various matrices and mitigate those matrix interferences. But also, we want it to shorten the turnaround time and sometimes prioritize the analysis of samples that are just urgent that may affect our fill rates. The next step was defining a scope. Although most companies they opt for sending their samples to contract laboratory for pesticide residue testing, we decided to keep it in house and and define the scope of the pesticides that we were going to screen for, we have opted for using commercially available mixes to cover a broad range of pesticides most commonly seen and food supply or prohibited from from use. So for the GCM edible pesticides, we have created a list of 217 residues and for the LCM anabol pesticide group, the list is a little bit larger and contains 254 residues. What about 15% of overlap between the GC and the LC group. And if you look close enough, this is our separation on the LC and GC. So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of different colorful peaks it\u0026rsquo;s it is a truly a beautiful separation. Next, we had to design a process that would fit in a cGMP environment. So that\u0026rsquo;s from the start was quite an undertaking because for those working in the area of residue testing things are not always black and white. Sometimes the deviation from a standard process is just necessary. So we had a couple of tasks to build and to make sure that the process is going to work. You efficiency when you had to develop an acquisition method and optimize it to cover the scope of the pesticide residues that we chose to look at, need also to develop a method for efficient data processing. To quickly assess the acquired data and conclude it a result, we also needed to design a functional reporting template that will allow us to quickly report the results and make it easy to review. And as I mentioned before, we needed to develop different methods for sample preparation to accommodate various matrices. And setting up quality control criteria is a very important step in setting up a functional process in the cGMP environment. When it came to instrumentation choices, we have done a market research. We wanted to choose something that was versatile and robust. So we\u0026rsquo;ve opted for the thermo scientific trace 1310 GC, that is equipped with the T SQ 9000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, the analysis of residues is done in Otter SRM mode. And we are also using the chameleon software for data acquisition and analysis. And this is our actual setup in the laboratory of our GC Mass Spec. Very brief overview of our GCMs ms method, this method allows us for determination of 217 pesticide residues. Currently, we\u0026rsquo;re using a 30 meter column, but we can easily switch to a 15 meter column for fast GC separation with unchanged the resolution and we have done that. And the resolution does not change maybe, except for a couple of Cypress runs that elude a little bit closer but other than that, it is a fast separation. And the maintenance of the hardware is very low. Because of the high robot robustness of the ion source. We really don\u0026rsquo;t have to bring that instrument down for maintenance often it is truly a workhorse. So, if you take a look on the right hand side, I have a shortcut and a summary of the method that we are using for the GC ms analysis. And again, this one reflects a separation on the 30 meter column or separation, sample preparation for the GC analysis. I put a quick summary of the procedure, we are weighing approximately one gram of a sample and a 50 mil centrifuge tube the sample is then hydrated with 10 mils of water and extracted with 10 mils of acetyl nitrile containing internal standards. So this is basically a first step of caterers and then the mixture is being salted out with on hydrous magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride. So as I as I mentioned this, this is just a simple salting out procedure taken from captures, however, that upper portion of the extract is then cleaned up using an SPE procedure. So we\u0026rsquo;re using a combination of PSA and graphitized Carbon Black, for cleaning up of the botanical matrices. And after the cleanup procedure. The sample as is eluded from the SPE cartridge, evaporated and reconstituted until you were in before the analysis with the GCMS. This is not a procedure that we just came up with. This is a method that we have validated with with the FDA So doc Howard Hayward, and John Hwang have developed this this method and we were part of the multi laboratory validation program to validate this this method and It works really, really well on botanical matrices. So, this is just the reference, if anybody\u0026rsquo;s interested in details regarding this, this methodology, but this is basically what we are using for majority of botanicals as far as sample preparation goes for the GCMS analysis. So, for the LC ms analysis, we decided to go with the Vanquish H fields See, that is equipped with the Altos triple quad mass spectrometer. And similarly to the GCMS, we are detecting the analytes and our SRM mode. And once again, we are using our chameleon software for data acquisition and analysis. And the picture below shows our setups our setup is, is consisting actually of three instruments because we\u0026rsquo;re trying to use our instruments for different applications. So in combination with the Vanquish HPLC and the mass spec, we also have an IC setup for the glyphosate analysis. So very briefly, the LCMS method allows for determination of 254 pesticide residues and I, my previous slide had a separation showing although speaks the instrument sensitivity allows for a dilution of the sample. So sometimes, to mitigate matrix interferences, it\u0026rsquo;s just easier to dilute the sample and that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we do. So on the right hand side, there is a table with a summary of our LCMS method. It\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s a really nice separation, and we\u0026rsquo;re separating all the peaks within 16 minutes. But because of heavy matrix, our runtime is 20 minutes. So, here I have a summary of the sample preparation for our LC analysis. Similarly to the GC, sample preparation, or starting with the catcher\u0026rsquo;s salting out procedure. However, further past that procedure, we are using different sample cleanup procedures. Those may include this versus SPE cleanup, or direct injection, depending on what kind of matrix we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with. Clean up can can can vary. So, if we have a fatty material, sample preparation will will differ ever. So slightly. After the cleanup procedure, the LOI is evaporated or diluted with deionized water pseudo nitrile before the analysis. So, as you can see, we have different sample preparations for both LC and on GC. And I did not mention, but the sample preparation also includes spiking of the matrix and are all calibration curves are also constructed in the matrix. So we are using matrix match calibration curves, as well as internal standard correction for any possible analyte loss during the extraction. The method was validated. Using the Sante guidance document on analytical quality control and method validation procedures for pesticide residues analysis and Susan feet. We chose eight representative matrices for the validation. If we were to do it on all 300 matrices, I don\u0026rsquo;t think a lifetime would be enough to space them out and complete all that work. So we decided to do the validation on the representative sample set. Does the parameters included linearity limit of detection limit of quantitation analyte recovery and precision? And as I mentioned before extraction efficiency and matrix effects were corrected. With the use of internal standards, we have a different set of internal standards for LC and GC, that are LC or GC unmountable. So, for the software selection, we had a choice between a tray finder or chameleon. However, after reviewing both platforms, the group decided to choose chameleon to run belts instrument. And there were a couple of factors that made us decide to go with with the chameleon software. And I will explain our choice in just a little bit. Coming in and software is capable of running both LC and the GCMS. And the report templates can be created and consistent between both instruments, basically, for streamlining purposes. And the ease of use of software allows for much faster data processing, and reporting in a quality control environment. And quite frankly, who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like Charlie, he\u0026rsquo;s so darn cute. So one of the biggest bottlenecks of any comprehensive time consuming analysis is the software ability to deliver functional necessary for creating streamline process. Having two options, you know, between trace binder and chameleon once, once again, we looked at various Bellet, Belize to review the port data of both platforms. And as I said before, chameleon was was our choice. And once the process of sample preparation and analysis was optimized, and validation under Billing, who had to think about the review and reporting process and how to design so everyone knows that the data review and data review, which contains hundreds and hundreds of residues is extremely tedious. I believe this is the biggest bottleneck of the whole process. So, again, identifying the features which make the process a little bit easier as critical. So one of those features which makes in my experience and the team\u0026rsquo;s experience, life much easier is the Smart Link features. So this slide shows the smart smart link peak presentation for a quick assessment of data, which can be easily customizable, depending on one\u0026rsquo;s preferences. So when I reviewed data and I need to look quickly at what was acquired whether there are any any hits in the batch, I look at my Smart Link overlaid peaks. For example, Jerry prefers to to look at them stacked. So the ability to customize views, depending on one\u0026rsquo;s preference is absolutely fabulous with within this software. So all information necessary to determine the data quality and the compound presence or absence is in one place. We really don\u0026rsquo;t need to switch between different windows to access information that we need for for quick assessment of the data and I pointed out to two locations to views where a compound having a green checkmark meets requirements and simply hovering over that green checkmark compound shows the meeting requirements which are preset in a data processing method. The same with a compound that does not meet the preset requirements just hovering over the red checkmark shows the reason why the compound does not meet the requirements. So this feature is great for quick assessment of component presence of absence and on the spot evaluation of the quality control criteria that we\u0026rsquo;re preset in on In the data processing methods so when a compound is detected, we need to report it and once again the ease of accessing various views and information. With a switch of view, it\u0026rsquo;s fantastic within within this software package, because in one view, I can see the response to the peak my standard curve and ion ratios, as well as the results. What the team also likes about this particular feature is the ability to customize the tables to include results, additional results, additional evaluation of the data with an addition of a column, the software is Excel based, so any modifications can be made on the on the fly with the results pretty much instantaneously. Once the data is reviewed, a custom report can be generated. And we have easily created a report template from existing reporting functions to fit our needs. So this is an example of our internal report that we use for reporting pesticide residues. And it contains a table with our probable hits quantitation non detected compounds. And creation of that particular report template was was very easy. It is thoughtfully customizable. And it\u0026rsquo;s really user friendly. There\u0026rsquo;s no coding necessary, there is a lot of options as it comes to functions, which are quite intuitive and allow building reporting templates that fit the needs of the customer. So we were able also to include a header for reviewers for secondary review, once again to fit our cGMP environment. But even with the tools that we have available, the process is quite difficult to place under the cGMP umbrella, we still have strict documentation requirements. To support strong quality systems, we have to have defined acceptance criteria. And again, comprehensive data review and approval process creates additional challenge. So how do we make this all work, we need to be able to allow flexibility and the controlled environment by clearly defining expected deviation. So we know sometimes if it comes to data interpretation for pesticide residues, as I mentioned before, things are not always black and white, we need to be able to deviate from a design path. But in order to approve that deviation, we have to explain and define what kind of deviations are acceptable. We are using software features to streamline the data and review and report process to optimize the workflow. We all know that this is a very laborious workflow. And in order to make it work, we have to have clearly defined way of doing things. I also create defined work structure within the group. So those three people that are responsible for the sample preparation, the analysis and reporting. They need to have a clearly defined responsibilities to make this work. They work as a team and they should be able to communicate within and divide and conquer. And we are striving for continuous improvement of the process. We\u0026rsquo;re fairly be new to it, especially in our environment. So we\u0026rsquo;re identifying areas in which we can improve processes that we can implement to make, once again, this, this whole workflow more and more functional. One of the areas that we see an opportunity to improve on is the integration of the process with data management system. So for further automation, and workflow, streamline, integration of the developed process with the lens system is very, very beneficial. So the combination of the powerful software capability with the data management system will allow us eventually for a smooth workflow, management and visibility throughout the whole process. Once again, from the very beginning to starting from a sample preparation, through the analysis and reporting. And a summary, we\u0026rsquo;ve built and implemented a pesticide residue testing program utilizing two analytical platforms, the GC and SMS and our cmsms. For high throughput workflow to screen a total about 500 pesticide residues in botanical matrices. The sample preparation was optimized for groups of botanical matrices, and targeted towards matrix mitigation. And this process can be implemented in a quality control environment for monitoring pesticide residues and botanical matrices. Just very quickly, I wanted to shout out to the pasty team, the shawl Jerry and Arman for doing a wonderful job. thank you to Aaron and Alan for allowing me to to do the work that we do up now. And of course, to thermo scientific, for letting me talk about the wonderful work that we do have now foods. Well, thank you, Katie, for that excellent presentation. We now have time for the question and answer sections. So Katie, the first question we have today is what regulatory limits does now food use when defining acceptance criteria. So when defining acceptance criteria, we look at global allowances and global MRLS. We also look at the acceptance criteria that are defined in CFR and because the acceptance criteria for botanical matrices are not very well defined as compared to fresh produce. And because NOW Foods distributes and sells products worldwide, we want to make sure that our acceptance criteria are in line with global allowances therefore we implement the most stringent acceptance criteria if it comes to two pesticide residues, but you already have our residues have action limits of 10 parts per billion or lower? Thank you, Kathy. We have a second question here, which is why is the sample preparation for LC and GC analysis different when most labs use one extraction to run both techniques? That is correct majority of laboratories prepare to sample using straight up cutters sample preparation and then they split the acetyl nitrile extract analyzed by LC and GC. And for streamlining purposes, that may work a little bit better. However, this is not an appropriate process if it comes to botanical matrices, and the analysis of complex samples that we deal with on a daily basis. Because the GC analysis performs better when using solvents like Tony Wayne, and the method that was developed and validated by Dr. Hayward and dr. long work works beautifully, we decided to implement that in our laboratory. But for the LLC, we decided to stick with what works better for the LLC. In regards to the sample preparation and have those samples in a pseudo nitrile water, it does require to prep the sample twice. However, the results and the recoveries of analytes that we look at for either GC Mass Spec or LC mass spec is much more much more intuitive. And we can we can recover more residues that way, and we can mitigate matrix interferences much better utilizing two procedures as opposed to just one. Okay, thank you very much, Katie, I think we have a quite an important question next, which is what happens to an ingredient which has detected pesticide residues above the tolerance level. We return it to the vendor, that ingredient is always rejected, we notified a vendor of what we found. We are a very transparent company. And we want to make sure that those issues are communicated with with vendors. Things happen, and we do see those cases, but in every case of the sort of material is rejected and never used in manufacturing of our products. Thank you, Kathy. We have another question here, which is how many internal standards are included in your LC, ms ms method for the pesticides. For the LC Ms. method, we are using a set of seven deuterated internal standards that cover different groups of pesticides. So Katie, the next question we have is, during sample preparation, you use dispersive SPE for sample cleanup, can you talk about the recovered results for this? So as I mentioned before, for both the GC and LC, we are using slightly different sample preparation, but both involve our sample cleanup using an SPE technique. So for the GC, once again, because the method is targeted specifically for botanical matrices, our recoveries are really good. It all depends on the matrix that we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with and some matrices, even with this optimized methodology, they are they\u0026rsquo;re still difficult and we see higher losses, but those losses are never higher than 5% of the group that we are looking at recoveries are typically within the 75 to 120%. With the GC we have to get a little bit more creative. Depending whether the matrix is high and fat or protein, we have to utilize a different DSP II cartridge. And once again, we see sometimes a higher losses if the matrix is is more difficult. And sometimes those losses are not really associated with the type of SPE that we are using, but with the matrix interference and in which case, we need to dilute the sample to see a little bit more through the matrix. But as I mentioned before, sometimes things are not clear cut if it comes to sample preparation analysis of such difficult matrices. So so a certain level of creativity is necessary to to be able to overcome those issues. Thank you, Katie. Our next question is, what did you consider when choosing instrumentation for this job. When we looked at what\u0026rsquo;s available on the market and different vendors, we wanted an instrument that will basically become a workhorse in our environment. But we also looked at something that will be versatile. Pesticides are not the only analysis that we are performing in house. We have a lot of different methods that require instrumentation LC or GCMs back instrumentation. So we wanted an instrument that will be easily adaptable to different methodologies. And that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we got with both LC and GC. As I showed earlier on the picture, the LC ms that we\u0026rsquo;re using for pesticide residue analysis is also utilized for the glyphosate analysis with the simple addition of ice. So that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we were looking for. And, and we\u0026rsquo;re really happy with our choices. Great. Thank you very much, Katie. And I think the final question we have today is, what aspect of having the in house pesticide testing program is most vital, valuable from a company\u0026rsquo;s perspective? Being able to control the process for sure, from addressing the sample preparation or difficulty, through the analysis, being able to always go back and look at the data and rationalize through things when when issues arise, and be able to report data ourselves. But also the the turnaround time, sometimes we need those results really quickly. We are manufacturing facility and prioritizing samples that are that are of a higher urgency within our environment. It\u0026rsquo;s something that we that we needed to be able to do in house. Okay, well, once again, Katie, thank you very much for your presentation today. If any, welcome, if any other questions do come in. I\u0026rsquo;m sure Katie would be happy to respond to my email afterwards. Thank you also to our scientific partners in this webinar being Thermo Fisher Scientific for all their technical input and support. And with that, I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank you all for logging in and listening today. Thank you, and goodbye.\n"},{"id":41,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Others/Pesticide_residues_challenge/","title":"The Challenges of Pesticide Analysis","section":"Other Courses","content":" The Challenges of Pesticide Analysis - LC or GC Triple Quadrupole?\nTranscript #  Thank you very much for the introduction here. Now, my first question to both experts is, well, we know that a large number of testing laboratories using triple quadrupole, GC and LC instruments for high throughput for targeted pesticide analysis. Now, based on your experience, what are the main challenges of triple quadrupole analysis, especially when you look at a comprehensive list of pesticides and many different sample types of varying complexity, and you still have to meet the regulatory requirements? And the fast turnaround times? Who would like to start? Well,Katie? Sure.\nKatie\nSo I guess, I guess, um, from my, from my perspective, no matter the technique, if we\u0026rsquo;re talking about GC and LC, triple quad approach, I think the best the biggest challenge is, is meeting those ever growing expectations. So we are continuously being asked for faster turnaround times and higher sensitivity, and the high demand the permanent high demand from our customers, leads the development of methods that are more sensitive and robust, and allow us to obtain the results and have the time because you know, the time time is money, you know, and especially in, in production in industry, where we need to meet those, you know, expectations and really, really quick turnaround times. So, we\u0026rsquo;ve been continuously working on improving our methodology. So that comes to GC and LC a mass spectrometry, but it\u0026rsquo;s not as easy as it sounds. There\u0026rsquo;s a very fine line between science and art in developing a multiresidue testing, testing method and as I\u0026rsquo;ve said, you know, we do have other options. However, majority of laboratories are still focusing on LC and NGS. The triple quad mass spec approaches for multiresidue methods. The attempt to detect and identify and quantitate hundreds of residues, while satisfying the regulatory requirements sometimes require some very innovative approach and when methods call for hundreds and hundreds of pesticides, it\u0026rsquo;s quite difficult to, to navigate through those residues and and bundle them into into two different methods and hope for the best and I agree they\u0026rsquo;re different approaches. However, most of the laboratories are still focusing on the termination of multiresidue pesticide testing using GC and LC. So employing two simultaneous approaches LC and GC. and fine tuning the method parameters allows for efficient way of screening large number of residues, and the orthogonal approach for the analysis of either LC or GC unmountable compounds definitely helps. However, with even the meticulously optimized methods, when it comes to difficult matrices and analysis of those matrices, we\u0026rsquo;re still having multiple, multiple challenges. So oftentimes, various matrices require specialized sample preparation and even though catcher still remains the main technique for sample preparation, modifications of those of those methodologies need to be implemented to allow for low detection limits. Katie for that insight, lookers? Well, as Katie said, time is money and if we want to achieve fast turnaround times, if we want to provide the results to the customer in a relatively short time, we need fast chromatography, but not only fast, but also selective and robust, it means that we cannot go to the Method Editor and you know design a short steep gradient because if we want to work with long target lace with difficult mattresses, short chromatographed Very steep gradient will not work because we will have a lot of problems related to solutions, because we because we will have collisions between pesticide between pesticide and matrix compounds. It means that we we may expect some interferences ion suppression also we have a very short gradient probably will have very short was worse time by which time, I mean the time where we have the part of the gradient, where we have 100% of the stroke mobile phase, so, it means that the will not win the column correctly and we may expect some late looting matrix compounds in the next injection. So, I think that something very interesting to improve the the productivity is a multi channel chromatography, I myself have been working for 18 months with a dual channel system and is something extremely useful, especially for the for the routine work because in the dual channel system, we have two columns, two injection lines, and we can design synchronize the injections on both columns. And by that we are able to eliminate the the idle time of the mass spectrometer So, the mass spectrometer is constantly acquiring the data, we don\u0026rsquo;t have the situation that we know from the single sound system that at the beginning of the gradient the mass spec is waiting for the illusion of the first analyte after the illusion of the last analyte the instrument is waiting for the end of the gradient then is waiting during the column re calibration working with the external systems. We eliminate all those steps and we can improve the productivity or about 50% easily and what is very important here that we do not affect the selectivity because we have normal gradient normal gradient dragging the same single channel system. And also the autonomous system gives us possibility to extend the column the watch time so instead of three minutes with 100% of the storm or face we can have five or six Minutes. And by that we improve the robustness of the system. So to work to analyze routine samples to have good sample throughput, I think that an extremely interesting option is dual channel chromatography. I think because you have two types of challenges there. First of all, of course, you have the challenge of being more rapid and more efficient. But then at the same time, you have to develop method that if push comes to shove up courtroom safe, because you\u0026rsquo;re developing methods for the competent authorities that are being used in the country than the EU member countries for enforcement. So you have to ensure that those methods not only are rapid, but also robust and reproducible and in line with what the court would accept. Yes, yes, absolutely. All the methods must meet those all those criteria. Thank you. So moving on to my next question here for you. That is, in your opinion, we start with Katie first, in your opinion, what do you think is the most challenging sample matrix you already mentioned that some of the matrices that you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with are very tricky for pesticide analysis, and what should let professionals take note when analyzing with triple quadrupole ms, either GCR LC Sorry, I have not had a chance to deal with all matrices that that could be possibly analyzed for pesticide residue contamination. But based on my experience, botanical matrices are probably most difficult to deal with the complexity of botanical powders and extracts create a difficult to deal with challenges. An example is cannabis. And although we don\u0026rsquo;t deal with cannabis, per se, but there are plenty of botanical matrices that create similar challenges. Anything that is heavily pigmented or terpene, heavy, is very difficult to clean and leave the matrix without removing the potentially present incurred residue. So there is, again, a little bit of art in making sure that we clean up just enough without removing the possibly present and current residues. And for lab professionals, they should understand the nature of the matrix that they\u0026rsquo;re dealing with before they choose the appropriate sample preparation approach. There are multiple references and resources that can guide professionals towards a suggested approach for sample preparation. For example, for fatty matrices for highly pigmented may have matrices for high water content matrices. So those are good options to start with. However, looking into the chemical composition of the matrix, that that we\u0026rsquo;re trying to, to deal with is is very, very important to understand the properties and perceive potential issues, if it comes to two matrix interferences, difficult matrices. What was your most difficult matrix? And what is your advice to the users? Well, I could give you some examples of very challenging matrix and some dry commodities like tea, or maybe some spices like black pepper. But I think that if we want to find out the real challenging matrix, we have to take into account two factors. One factor is the difficulty but by itself, so everything what is related to the eye on separation interferences. And the second factor, which is also very important, is the number of the samples of that commodities that your lab is going to analyze. And we have to find some kind of crossover point between the difficulty and the number of the of the samples because let\u0026rsquo;s say that your laboratory is going is performing performs 10,000 analysis 10,000 samples per year. And let\u0026rsquo;s say that you analyze on the 20 samples and in the same time you analyze say 3000 on your samples on is a challenging matrix, but obviously is not such a disarray. It\u0026rsquo;s not so difficult as the but I expect that for you more problematic will be Anyang because of the because of the total amount of the samples that you are going to analyze. So I think that each laboratory will have its own difficult matrix that display a set a crossover point between the difficulty and the and the number of the samples of each commodity. and advice is well, here, I think that is, obviously, what is very important is chromatography, something what I mentioned before the gradient cannot be very short, and also the MS method, because I think that still there are some people who are obsessed with the sensitivity when they optimize campaigns for the for the triple quads, and they forget about the selectivity, which is also something extremely important that some people simply they\u0026rsquo;re chasing the highest possible sensitivity and they, they are able to use transitions that are non selective, like some neutral losses or transitions with very small product ions. And it\u0026rsquo;s something quite dangerous when you work with with difficult matrices, because if you use non selective transitions, maybe you will not have false positives, because it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to find a pulse false positives, because you need the retention time to translate to and translations and the volume ratio. But if you have the retention time and the ion transition, that is the same as one of your analyte, you may obtain a false negative because it will affect the volume ratio. And besides, besides that, besides the selectivity of the transitions, also, when the method is ready, is very important to evaluate the method, you know, globally, that okay, I have my all my transitions, I don\u0026rsquo;t see any, any coiltek isobaric transitions, but it\u0026rsquo;s very important also to think about isotopes because, you know, some pesticides, especially those with chloride, bromide are high number of carbon atoms. They have very, very intensive isotopes and the isotopes that you don\u0026rsquo;t see in the metal, maybe isobaric with with some your of your analytes. So I think that this is a something that is very important to, to, to have the method that is selective. Thank you very much, both of you for the advice. Katie, did you want to add something or? Yes, I wanted to, I wanted to touch upon what was woocash mentioned regarding the volume of samples and the possible challenges that come come with that I agree that the volume of certain matrix can can create challenges. But I think, and I\u0026rsquo;m speaking from from experience, and what we do in our laboratory, the inconsistency and different matrices, because we never know what\u0026rsquo;s coming our way, right, we have over 400 Different botanical matrices that we need to be able to analyze in our lab. So in our case, the difficulty doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with the volume of any given matrix, but the versatility and the different matrices that we can receive every day. So we need to be ready to to make a decision and come up with the best possible solution to mitigate the matrix and appearances, the issues and perhaps modify the method as we go to accommodate those those challenges to to mitigate those challenges. So, to your point, I understand that yes, if we\u0026rsquo;re if we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with many samples of any given matrix, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult however, you can streamline the process or come up with a solution that will help you get through those multitude of samples in our particular case, the difficulty is in in those multitudes of matrices that we have to have solutions for. So, our approach to that is again looking into the matrix and looking at those possible issues. And perhaps Yes, we do have to modify the methodologies to remove some of those matrix interferences and change those ions and and switch things around to reach that specificity of the method that we need in order to accurately assess the the incurred residues and our matrix. So the difficulty is in, in the nature of the botanical matrix, and we have to be prepared, we have to have those solutions ready for when we need to use them. Thank you very much Lukash any any comments to that or are we good? No. Thank you, then we move on. When you look around the world, you will see She\u0026rsquo;ll be the fruit and vegetable producing major producing countries, you will find that not all the production and also not all the use of pesticide that alone their authenticity is controlled in a way that we may see that in the US or in Europe. So, my question for you is, you know, we can see from from the media reports that there are counterfeit counterfeit products and they becoming more prevalent in the market, what are your thoughts on the prevalence issue of counterfeit products on the market and can or how can GC MSMS or LC ms ms or high resolution accurate maths such as orbitrap technology address those challenges? Again, the since Katie was the last to speak, I\u0026rsquo;m giving the first time first option to answer to Lucas Well, I agree that all the issues related to food frauds are are very important today and they for sure, they they will be even more important in the future because the the market for some special types of food is constantly growing a special type of food I understand organic food or food with some specific geographical origin and is something very important to protect the customer because if you go to the supermarket and then and you decide to pay more, because you see the label that stands for organic food, you must be sure that you are already paying for the for organic products and well how can we distinguish between food from different types of production? Or how can we confirm the origin the geographical origin of food, well, we need some some markers and means that substances that are characteristics characteristic for for example, for the organic food and here obviously on the on the on the frontline, we have high resolution mass spectrometry because it\u0026rsquo;s a it\u0026rsquo;s an excellent technique to work with unknown compounds, because high resolution mass spectrometry is very sensitive and selective in the scanning boat, people think that people possess sensitive they are sensitive, because they are operated in the in the target mode. However, in nontarget mode, high resolution mass spectrometry is much better and this is very helpful in identification of the substances and here what is very important in my opinion the very good handwarmer we must be also supported by very good software extremely especially in this in this type of applications. Because well, if you work in with some target samples, with some you analyze pesticides, you spend relatively short time the data processing No in fact, the data processing whether the target analysis is short term the data acquisition, however, if you work with a noun compounds, now, you inject one sequence and then you you spend weeks processing the data. So, here for this purpose to find the markers that help us to distinguish between different types of foods to find those fingerprints, for example of geographical origin, while we need high resolution mass spectrometry supported by by very good software. Thank you. So, we have these different facets of looking at counterfeit products. So you have either the food product, but also there is a certain number of counterfeit pesticides in the market, they may have different active ingredient V the pesticide may be the same or similar slightly modified. Are you seeing that in your laboratory? Well, you mean no because we don\u0026rsquo;t analyze the pesticide like you know, because you refer to the to the products that are that are applied in the field. Yes. Now, we Anna we analyzed on the pesticide residues. So I cannot add anything to that because because we we don\u0026rsquo;t analyze the the products. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much, Katie. We can define counterfeit products, different ways. And similarly to what Lucas said. We\u0026rsquo;re not looking at counterfeit pesticides, but from the industry standpoint We\u0026rsquo;re looking at different counterfeit cases. So we may look at, let\u0026rsquo;s say steroid contamination of botanical ingredients that we would not even expect that would be there. Also, we\u0026rsquo;re looking at adulterations have a count of feet. I\u0026rsquo;m compounds and I have a really good example I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about that. It\u0026rsquo;s not really related to pesticides. But it\u0026rsquo;s really important to bring up from the counter fades standpoint, and highlights the issues that we have to deal with not only in the pesticide residue testing world, but in general in addressing adulteration and contamination in in the natural product industry, or food industry. So in December of 2019, we had received a complaint from our Canadian distribution center, but there\u0026rsquo;s a plus possible natural dietary supplement that supports sleep, that people are reporting very interesting side effects from it, we looked at the components of that it was all botanical. And what really caught our attention was people were reporting this metallic taste after they, they woke up in the morning, and that made us think, what could cause that because this is one of the side effects of Lunesta, right? So people were reporting that they can sleep through the night after taking just one pill. And we started that investigation. So not having the high resolution, mass spec at that time, we had to employ different techniques to find out and come to a conclusion of what that that supplement contains. Long story short, we\u0026rsquo;ve employed some HPLC UV techniques combined with some LC Tov analysis, and we determined that what we found was a version or initially we thought it was the speaker sound as as a peak loan as a peak loan, which is Lunesta. But then digging a little bit deeper, we found out that it is really not because chlorine in that compound was substituted with bromine. And we nicknamed it Bo P cologne, because that was a completely novel compound that was created to prevent laboratories like us from targeted analysis of this compound. Because if we if we employed a target analysis, we would never find it. And and our findings, the next day were confirmed by by the FDA and that supplement was was pulled from from a shelf. Later, we were able to employ the high resolution mass spec to confirm our findings. So we took the long way. Yes, there. There are easier ways of finding those, those counterfeit products. But this is just an example of us trying to constantly play this patch with a quite sophisticated scientific approach to fool us into believing that this product is a natural product and it helps you sleep. Thank you for sharing that story with us, Katie, that was very interesting, how you discovered that there was some adulteration in the in the product. I think there are plenty of stories around and I think now, what you find is that especially LC ms ms. Also high resolution accurate mass is used for more the screening approaches also for non target in a non targeted way. Now, that brings us also to the next question. So, there is an interest in the non target acquisition using high resolution accurate methods such as orbitrap technology to increase the analyte scope of the methods. My first part of the question is can you give an assessment of your experience with this instrument and a prediction on when and how that might impact on the workflow? for pesticides and we\u0026rsquo;ll start with Lucas. Well, I have very positive experience with high resolution mass spectrometry in the routine pesticide analysis because well I work with with an orbitrap that is accredited under 17 Oh 25 under ISO 17 Oh 25 And we are analyzing routine sample with with this instrument and we have very good results. But well, let\u0026rsquo;s be honest that if you want to start pesticide residue analysis, the first place you need an LC triple quad and GC triple quad, because of the sensitivity issues, because for sure, you will have to analyze some some samples that will require very high sensitivity because of the because the ion suppression or maybe it will be some special application where the MRLS are very low, like for example, maybe food. So for those special tasks, we will need a table quads. But if you if you have those two instruments, you may start to think about the high resolution instrument because we have high resolution and mass spectrometry you can analyze the easy matrix or matrices with moderate difficulty and Well, I think that still some people have a little bit false image of the high resolution because they think that you cannot quantify with high resolution mass spectrometry, that\u0026rsquo;s only technology that is good for screening application. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not true anymore, it was maybe it was true 15 years ago, but today modern instrument we quantify very good. And you know, as the instrument is accredited, we participate in proficiency test and with high resolution mass spectrometry always we have very good results, very low SAT scores. And while also and the other part of the false image of the high resolution mass spectrometry is that people think that it\u0026rsquo;s something difficult that may high resolution mass spectrometry is more difficult than triple quadrupole mass spectrometry? Well, it can be it\u0026rsquo;s a very versatile technique that you have different applications that you have very, very difficult application like for example, some unknown analysis, but you have something less difficult like suspect screen. When you screen your samples against the databases or spectral libraries, you don\u0026rsquo;t have the standard you don\u0026rsquo;t know the retention time you don\u0026rsquo;t know the behavior of the company or system. So, you need some experience you need to experience in mass spectrometry and pesticide analysis and finally, you have target routine analysis pesticide and hear my opinion there is no difference between triple quads and high resolution mass spectrometry because if you want to have a triple quad, you have you have two peaks in the calibration line and the calibration curve and a high resolution mass spectrometry also you have to patient the calibration curve. So, the data processing data is in both types of of mass spectrometry is is the same and you know the method development is easier with with high resolution with private solution because there is no optimization you have non target acquisition. And I also think that you know, for newcomer high resolution mass spectrometry maybe even easier to understand because the concept of full scan or even full scan combined with all I\u0026rsquo;m trying meditation is something much easier to understand the concept of the of the ion transition. So, high resolution mass spectrometry is not so it\u0026rsquo;s not so difficult as as some people may think. Thank you very much. Look at Katie, do you share Lucas view on that or Absolutely I could not agree with you more. I think the biggest misconception if it comes to high resolution mass spec was the the inability of the lab staff to handle that topology and I agree that is a simpler approach comes to to the screen as the analysis using the GC or LC triple quad and I also agree with starting with the GC or LC or both and establishing a program that way and then jumping into into a high res analysis and this is exactly that started with a we are fairly new to this high resolution accurate mass analysis and the pesticide world have been exploring the possibility of using utilizing the orbitrap technology for the non targeted data acquisition. And and I agree that this this can streamline the process tremendously and, and is also more cost effective LC GC Mass Spec requires, you know, much more input as far as you know, standards, optimization of the methodology, right, you have mentioned that the high resolution accurate mass methodology doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be optimized specifically for or the compounds that we\u0026rsquo;re trying to, to look at, contrary to the GC or LC there\u0026rsquo;s a substantial amount of work that needs to go into optimization of the method. And really, we don\u0026rsquo;t need trained professionals to be able to run those those instruments in the quality control setting, that\u0026rsquo;s why a decision was made with with a now to pursue that technology to streamline the process to be able to screen for more residues and expand the scope outside of just the targeted data dependent acquisition into you know, hundreds of more compounds within a single shot. Thank you, me to follow up just with a second half my question, because I think that fits very well. So, do you first see that triple quadrupole and high resolution accurate math is used in a complementary approach? Or are you moving or do you think that labs will make more moving towards the high resolution accurate as well and I think that the it depends who will work faster the engineers from the mass spec companies that are improving the systems because still we know that the high resolution mass spectrometry is less sensitive than the triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. So, cool work faster the engineers from the mass spec companies or the people from the legislation bodies that are constantly decreasing the MRLS in if the if the engineers will work faster than the bureaucrats, I think that the future belongs to the high resolution mass spectrometry and I would like to add that you know, there is some is a very good approach from from the from the side of mass spec companies that now there are on the market, high resolution mass instruments that are dedicated for the for the residue market, and well the advantage of those instruments is that they are affordable, that you can, you can get a high risk instrument that in the price of of a of a triple quad. So, it\u0026rsquo;s something is something very important obviously, those instruments are not like, you know, high end high res instruments that are for example necessary for for proteomic studies, however, we for in the in the residue analysis, we don\u0026rsquo;t need all the all the features we we don\u0026rsquo;t need extreme resolutions, we we don\u0026rsquo;t need all the all the acquisition modes. However, we need high resolution because it helps it can help us a lot to solve a lot of problems. The screening that a Katie has mentioned in the screening is something quite interesting because it helps you to control your your target scope, because for example, you have a 350 pesticide in your triple quad and you don\u0026rsquo;t know if your scope is is correct, yes, you can bet with high resolution math instrument, you can easily double that number and simply screen for six 700 compounds and okay you can compare the results from your target scope and with screening against the shield\u0026rsquo;s database and for example, if you find tricky with your target scope, one or two positive per samples, but then with with your high resolution instrument you find Three or four more, it means that you should extend your your target scope, because you are you\u0026rsquo;re missing some some important compounds. And also something what is very nice in high resolution instruments is that you have an orthogonal technique for confirmation in your laboratory. Because obviously, there is a lot of orthogonality between LC and GC because the chromatography is different the dynamization is completely different, but not all the compounds can be analyzed by both by both techniques. And for example, if you have a problem with with some compounds in your LC, triple quad, for sure you are able to see to reanalyze that sample with your LC high resolution instrument. Thank you, Lucas, you share the view? KB. Yes, I agree. I agree with the with the fact that we can quickly screen for a larger number of compounds. And we\u0026rsquo;re not just limited to the targeted list that is either on our LLC or or do you see we\u0026rsquo;re expanding the scope. We\u0026rsquo;re also chasing something new, right we screening for, for hundreds and hundreds of pesticides, we\u0026rsquo;re talking 700 800 pesticides, we have a bigger chance of catching something that\u0026rsquo;s novel, right? Even if it\u0026rsquo;s if it\u0026rsquo;s just some some peak that we don\u0026rsquo;t identify. If, if there\u0026rsquo;s a completely new pesticide that is being used, we have a bigger chance of catching it as opposed to going with strictly to targeted analysis. Yes, the sensitivity is not the same. But again, there\u0026rsquo;s a trade off between a huge scope of looking at everything that is that is possible in the food or natural product industry. So I think this is a trade off that is worth making, for the sake of looking at the bigger scope of pesticides, but also the fact that with the Oh, the full screen, you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re capable of retrospectively looking at, at some data, right? If you\u0026rsquo;re looking only at a targeted analysis, there\u0026rsquo;s no way you can go back to that data, and you can reanalyze it. And let\u0026rsquo;s say we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a novel residue that just became hot and everybody\u0026rsquo;s talking about it, we have no way of of looking at our data and assessing whether that residue was there before or this is completely new. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s another ability that the accurate mass, the high resolution approach allows us to do. Yeah, I think that was a great point to make, that you can always go back to your data and analyze what you may have had maybe potentially already, hopefully not but may have had for 30 months in your products, you know, so so that that is a very valuable aspect. So first of all, thank you very much for very patiently asking a very answering all the questions that I had, I have one more for you. And Lucas already mentioned that the manufacturer constantly improve the instrument performance. My question again to both of you and we start with Katie, if you have the one wish, what you would like to see as an improved future, what would that be? If I can choose one, we\u0026rsquo;re constantly asking for, you know, improved sensitivity and speed, because those will always be the number ones that analysts and end users are asking for. Right? Because this is not just for us, I think we\u0026rsquo;re pushing an insane performance already if it comes to target analysis and becomes to to sensitivity and speed. So those will always be there. I think from if we\u0026rsquo;re talking just in terms of the instrument performance, I think from the quality control standpoint, what we are focusing on or counting on is robustness. And what I mean by that is the IS is the frequency of needing to bring the instrument down for planned maintenance. Okay. So I think it may sound silly, but from the productivity standpoint, again, you know, speed time is very important. So, improving the instrument performance or decreasing the frequency of planned maintenance, because that is just that that\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s really important to quality. control laboratory. And of course, you know, we always have those those wish lists. So, you know, we spend a lot of time on sample preparation and optimizing. You know, our chromatography. So, techniques that I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to, to have more explored over time are the ambient ionization techniques. Dust, the dark hyphenated with high res mass spec would also allow us for minimum treatment of a sample. And those could be potentially good solutions for pesticide residues, meaning Thank you look at your wish list. Well, if I get if I can choose only one, I want more sensitivity, because, you know, especially in the triple quad sensitivity is a resource is like a currency that you can exchange for something else. And you know, someone, right, someone could say that, okay, I have a good triple quad, all my ello Q\u0026rsquo;s are below MRLS, I don\u0026rsquo;t need more sensitive instrument. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not true, because if you have a more sensitive instrument, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to exchange the sensitivity for lower MOQ for example, you can exchange higher sensitivity for lower injection volume, and if you inject less well, you introduce less matrix into the system. So, you reduce necessity of the maintenance, you reduce the matrix effects, you prolong your your column lifetime, you improve your peak shape. So, there is a lot of benefits from from lower injection volume or if you have a more sensitive instrument, you can extend your method you can include more compounds, because more sensitive instrument will give you good response with shorter dwell times you can exchange higher sensitivity for better selectivity, because for example, you can go for more selective but less sensitive transitions, or maybe you can also decrease the quadruple isolation window instead of working with one or 1.2 you can go down to point seven or or point five, but Well, I would like to highlight that sensitivity is not something unconditional. The other aspects that you know, the sensitivity must be accompanied by other features. Know, for example, for us, we analyze pesticide residues, so, we have to quantify. So, for example, we need also broad dynamic range, because in the European Union, a huge number of pesticides, they have Mrs. MPVs, but they are pesticide with 20 that they have their Mrs. 20 or 50 or 100 500 PVS, even in the PPM levels. So, you know, if you have a very sensitive instrument, but we\u0026rsquo;ve narrow in our dynamic range, it means that some, some amount of your of your positives will be outside of your calibration curve. So, you will have to dilute and drain jugs your sample, so, you will waste that a lot of time. And also the issue that Katie mentioned the robustness, okay, you can offer me a very sensitive instrument, but the sensitivity is achieved by introduction of huge amount of matrix and the instrument becomes dirty, very, very fast. And you know, you start your sequence with this level of sensitivity and 30 samples later you are here. So I don\u0026rsquo;t want that instrument but because the the issue that Katie mentioned that you will have to stop, you will have to vent the instrument when the instrument and you waste a lot of time.\nIce-breaking #  Hello, everyone. I\u0026rsquo;m David hills from separation science, and I\u0026rsquo;m delighted to be able to welcome you to the first installment of that instrument selection discussion series developed in collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific. This series will take a look at a variety of different analysis challenges. And with the help of some expert panelists examine the pros and cons of instrumentation available to address these workflows, and to provide valuable insights based on real world experience and technical excellence. Today, we\u0026rsquo;re addressing the challenges of pesticide analysis LC or GC triple quadrupole. Through conversation between our three industry experts, but popping Katie Bella Shecky and Lucas Reishi and their experiences using triple quad and high resolution accurate mass instruments in conjunction with both LC and GC for the analysis and determination of pesticide residues. It\u0026rsquo;s a real pleasure to have such a distinguished group of panelists with us, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re all going to enjoy the next hour and learn a lot from their combined experiences. But Katie, and Luke cash will also be happy to answer your questions as a follow up to this discussion. So please do use the Ask a Question button below to address any issues you may have, or comments you\u0026rsquo;d like to make, based on what you hear during the discussion today. I\u0026rsquo;m now going to hand you over to the very capable hands of our moderator for today\u0026rsquo;s discussion. But popping. Those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know, but is managing director of the strategic food consulting company focus is company advisors, technology providers, food manufacturers, startup companies, not for profit organizations, investors and laboratories on strategic food safety solutions, and emerging technologies. Burt previously worked as chief scientific officer and Director of Scientific Development and Regulatory Affairs for global contract laboratories. He has over 25 years of experience in the food testing industry, and has authored over 75 peer reviewed publications on topics of food safety analysis, food allergens, food authenticity, validation and regulatory assessments.

He serves as scientific adviser to the EOSC international food authenticity taskforce and is co chair of the ALC food authenticity Task Force and vice chair of the USP food ingredients expert committee. Burt is also active in numerous national and international standardization organizations, including cn ISO, and several German official method working groups. And so, over to you but a very warm welcome to the separation science webinar challenges of pesticide analysis LC or GC triple quadrupole. The webinar is sponsored by thermo scientific while the use of pesticides contributes to ensure there is a high level of food supply, there are only considered safe if only small amounts remain in the fruit to be consumed. So the number of pesticides that could have potentially been used is very high. And detecting and quantifying them can be a significant challenge, particularly in widely different environments under a variety of regulatory framework. So the question is always, which is the instrument best suited for this task? Then the first part of the instrument selection discussion series, I have the pleasure of discussing that with two very well known experts in the field. And I think this kind of discussion is really important and useful. And I do recall when I had to decide on the instrumentation to buy we always only heard from the suppliers about the wonderful thing that their instruments can do and in some cases, how poorly the competition performs. So here separation science really closes the gap, an important gap with SEO As that now you can hear from the experts that use particular instrumentation on a daily basis. And they know best the ins and outs, pros and cons of their instruments. So today we take a look at the pros and cons of LC and GC triple quadrupole for the analysis of pesticides in food and agricultural matrices. And allow me to give you a short introduction to set the scene. First of all, I would like to briefly introduce myself my name is Bert popping, I was focused for consulting strategically, we have expertise in a number of specific areas in food safety testing at a global level, which includes allergens, gluten food fraud, but also the topic of today, the food residues like pesticides. Now the knowledge is combined with verticals for example, regulatory environment risk analysis was management, as well as technology development. So with these skills, we support food manufacturers, retailers, regulators, and technology providers ethical level. If you click the QR code, it will take you to a website. So now allow me to give you a background information. And I would like you to follow me on a very short journey through time. The practice of agriculture first began about 10,000 years ago in the fertile crescent of Mesopotamia. The area that today is part of Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan. Hunters and gatherers planted edible seeds from wheat, barley and peas, and started to cultivate land. But where you have monoculture pest will move in to take advantage of the plentiful offer of food. And who would have thought that even four and a half 1000 years ago, it is documented that they use pesticides to fight these pests. Back then they already use sulfur and 2000 years ago, there are records showing the use pirate drum, which is derived from the dry chrysanthemum flowers. Of course, synthetic pesticides, the likes that we see today started more recently. The first ones were used in the 1940s. And for the next 20 years or so consumers and most policymakers were not overly concerned with the potential health of pesticides. Food was cheaper because of the use of these pesticides. Now as research continued, it became obvious that pesticides did not only bring benefits. This was a time when regulation for the use of pesticides were introduced. In Europe, if so the European Food Safety Authority makes the assessment which level the so called maximum residue levels or MRLS are considered safe. These MRL so then placed into the regulatory framework by the European Commission. Irrespective of these regulatory action data within consumer concern. Many consumers simply do not like the idea of having pesticide residues in their food they\u0026rsquo;re eating no matter at which level and we also saw lobby groups campaigning to abolish the use of pesticide. Now in the current time, on top of everything else we are facing a significant challenge was Corona and corona puts a strain on the food supply chain. Most of you will remember in early 2020 People were panic shopping and bought a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of supply not only of durable foods, but strangely enough also of toilet paper. We saw empty shelves in March in Europe and also in the West. The food industry went to extraordinary lengths to restock a year\u0026rsquo;s worth of supply that consumers have bought only in a few weeks. And retailers and logistic companies did a fantastic job. They were able to restock shelves within a few weeks. What is very noticeable during the corona crisis is the uptake of organic produce. Consumers try to avoid what they consider unhealthy foods including those that contain pesticide residues. So the demand for organic flour, fruits and vegetables skyrocketed. Other organic produce categories that picked up significantly were meat, milk, potatoes and Vegetable oil. But how can it be reassured that the products really are organic, because when demand significantly outpaces supply, there is a very good chance that there is fraud, and in this case, organic fraud. And Europol stated in one of its reports from 2020, that they see organic fraud on the rise during Corona. So how would you know if your incoming goods are truly organic, especially when in person audits are often no longer possible. This is where all the burden is on the Food Testing Laboratory and the analyst conducting the test. And there is an increasing pressure from food manufacturers and other stakeholders in the food supply chain to test for more and more pesticides in a single run, to get more sensitive, and to get the results faster. So that was the introduction to the overall webinar of today. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s my absolute pleasure to introduce at ANA Chesky. She has 15 years of experience in the food industry, including the Institute of Food Safety and Health and Mars snack food in the US. She supervises a team of analytical chemist and method developed scientist and in her current position at NOW Foods, she works with a team of analytical chemists and method developers. And her and her team have led to the implementation of a routine pesticide monitoring program. Katie focuses on mass spectrometry and elemental analysis for food development, and has has authored multiple manuscripts in that field. So Katie, over to you. Thank you, Barry, it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s an absolute pleasure to be able to participate in this webinar. As Brad mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent about 15 years in the food industry across different roles. And currently am I in my position, I oversee a few groups of analytical chemists and scientists and we work together on implementing multiple methodologies. That would make us make sure that the raw materials and the finished products that now foods are the highest quality that we possibly can can get. I would like to think that our laboratories and now our state of the art laboratories, we are definitely a unique company that focuses on bringing testing capabilities in house. Some may think that this is a biased approach. However, we are working in a GMP environment, and we are communicating openly with our vendors and our customers. And honestly, I take pride in what we do and how we do and because the level of science that we are capable of doing in house is is a very high high level. Currently, I overlook not only the analytical and physical laboratories to implement various testing in house, we test roughly 4000 samples a month, it is a very high throughput laboratory. So majority of what we do is testing potency identity of raw materials and finished products. But we also do a lot of contamination testing screening to to ensure the safety of our ingredients. And as I mentioned, we were probably one of the few, if not only a laboratory in our industry that is capable of performing pesticide testing. In house we have the technology and we have the team that is skilled and trained on performing that type of analysis in house. So like I said, I\u0026rsquo;m very fortunate to be the leader of a fantastic group of scientists, and continuing what we do and taking, taking pride in our work and our outcome. Thank you so much, Katie. I\u0026rsquo;m now going to introduce Lukash. So, Dr. Luca Rach key is from the European reference laboratory for fruits and vegetables and Maria and Spain. The institute that is headed by Mr. Diaz Fernandez Alba, and their focus are pesticide residues and Lucas is an expert in the development and validation of analytical methods for pesticide detection, and quantification using advanced mass spectrometric technique. which includes both the high resolution and the triple quadrupole. Ms. So his focus and interest is the application of orbital banners, and time of flight commands for pesticide analysis. Lucas is also involved in the organization of European proficiency tests. And like Katie Lucas has published in numerous high impact journals, and contributed book chapters dedicated to pesticide residue analysis. So I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have wished for more competent partners in discussing the questions with so what maybe Lucas, you want to give a little bit of intro to yourself? Okay, thank you very much, Burt, thank you very much for the for the introduction and for the invitation. So my name is Katerina iski. Since 2011, I have been working at European Union reference laboratory for pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables in an in our laboratory, I\u0026rsquo;m responsible for the LCMS analysis by And hereby LCMS, I understand a whole bunch of instrumentation because I work with triple quads, I work with high resolution with both Jivox instrumentation with orbitrap with time of flight on the LC side, I use reverse phase chromatography, and also ion chromatography, my scientific work is focused on the application of high resolution mass spectrometry for the pesticide residue analysis, because, well, in the case of triple quads, the situation is quite well established, we know how to analyze pesticide with with triple quads and all the labs use the triple quads in the same more or less in the same way. However, in the case of high resolution instruments, we have more possibilities, we have more acquisition modes, we can create very interesting workflows. So this is something what what I\u0026rsquo;m investigating beside my scientific work, I\u0026rsquo;m also involved in on the on the typical activities of the European Union reference laboratory. So I analyze routine samples. I take part in the organization proficiency tests, because our laboratory every year organize PTS for the official laboratories that we have in the in the European Union. And also I participate in other activities like a collaboration with national reference laboratories, official, official laboratories, where some collaborations with third countries. So my work is, you know, includes a lot of a lot of aspects of pesticide residue analysis.\nPost comments #  Thank you so much for both sharing your wish list. And I\u0026rsquo;m very sure that the instrument manufacturer listened very closely to what you have said just now. They were all very valid points to raise. So with that, we\u0026rsquo;re coming to the end of our question and answer session. Again, thank you for patiently answering all the questions. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that we\u0026rsquo;re very valuable to the audience that is now listening to us. And I would like to thank you wish you well stay safe and healthy. I\u0026rsquo;ll hand back to separation science. Thank you, Bert. Well, what an excellent discussion.

Historically the limit has been 10%. Most procedures nowadays are performed on automated instruments using few manual steps if any at all. My lab director wants 10% for the LCMSMS as well. I have found this is not so easy. From an article I read from Validation Viewpoint the FDA recommends 15% for four of six points and 20% at the lower limit of quantitation. That seems rather wide for me but I don\u0026rsquo;t see why there can\u0026rsquo;t be some compromise between 10 and 15%.\nAs an example I am working up a Levetiracetam method on a UPLC/TQD. I get an obs error of 6.3% with concentrations 0 to 50 ug/mL. But pushing the upper limit to 75 ug/mL gets me an error up to 11%. He will not accept this. Problem is therapuetic range for this drug is up to 80 ug/mL which means we\u0026rsquo;ll be diluting quite a few samples.\nSolution:\nResponse #1:\nWhile MRM experiments usually provide sufficient specificity, I have often found that simply separating your analyte of interest from the matrix will vastly improve your RSDs and often increase the sensitivity of the method.\nResponse #2:\nIt will not be always easy to reach these 10% all the way in LC-MS/MS. FDA regulation is accepted almost everywhere\u0026hellip; A more robust source will help to achieve these limits for a specified assay: to help to stay away from the LOQ for this assay. What MS instrument do you have?\nHowever, here is a possible list from one of our application chemists of things to check for the system as a rough guide.\n  Detuning the Probe adjuster (spraying a little bit more far away from the Cone)\n  Highering dissolvation temperature and gas flow will help to get a better dissolvation\n  Eventually decreasing flow rate (especially on TQD) around 0.4 ml/min will help to get better RSD\u0026rsquo;s (also linked to dissolvation)\n  Too low capillary voltage may give higher sensitivity but may increase RSD (consider a test at 3kv and then compare with 1.5 and 1 kv, never go to 0.5kv).\n  Internal standard with deuterated compounds should be used.\n  Matrix effect is also something to consider, a very specific and selective sample prep will help to reduce RSDs.\n  In addition to this, Full loop injection will help from the UPLC end.\n  Reference:\nWaters: Accuracy for LC-MS/MS\n"},{"id":43,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-05-Troubleshooting/Agilent_troubleshooting_guide/","title":"Agilent HPLC \u0026 LC-MS Troubleshooting Guide","section":"Part V LC-MS Troubleshooting","content":" HPLC \u0026amp; LC-MS Troubleshooting\n"},{"id":44,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-02-Practices/Forums/","title":"Forums","section":"Part II Practices","content":" Agilent LC/MS Technical Forum\n Agilent application for Pesticides\n Waters LC-MS Technical Forum\n"},{"id":45,"href":"/docs/07-Troubleshooting/Part-01-Analysis-Troubleshooting/Internal_standard_variation/","title":"Internal standard Variation","section":"Analysis troubleshooting","content":"Situation:\nI got consistent response of internal standard in Method Validation.But during study sample analysis, I got variation more than 40% of mean response of calibration curve standards.

If you are using a LC/MS/MS method, it could be a matrix effect issue. Could also be a different behaviour during sample preparation, leading to a different recovery. A few questions and ideas:\n what method are you using for sample preparation? are you using the same anticoagulant in your standards/QCs and in your unknown samples ? how did you investigate matrix effect during method development and validation ? Did you try any post-column infusion as part of development ? how variable is your IS response in your unknown samples ?

I washed the column with 50% ACN to 90% ACN overnight and somehow there is now no analyte peaks. I tried for many types of standard, and only background noise can be obtained. Then, I checked the flow rate for washing column, and it is 0.5 ml/min. I am not sure if it is too high, cause I found there is a little solution leak from the top of probe sometime. ( Wondering if it is really a leakage, maybe I can take a photo if it comes again\u0026hellip;) I also used tune page with high selective analyte but again no signal observed.\nSolution:\n verify the system is in working condition and the instrument tune report ion abundances and peak widths should match approximately the same settings as when the system was first installed or was in working order. Did you guys perform a recent tune? This is your starting ground, if not you could have some sort of problem going on with the detector or quadrupoles or something else and would require a complete diagnostics by the service engineer. Are you guys maintaining vacuum? Did you prepare a fresh tuning solution? How is your gas supply, do you have enough collision cell gas and nebulizer gas? Is that an ESI source in positive polarity?  Solution:\nI finally called the engineer for help. The problem is that I really set flow rate too high, which making the inlet transfer tube broken and get off from the probe. So it means there is no injection to MS and of cause no signal can be found. Anyways, 0.5 ml/min is too high for uplc-msms system, that\u0026rsquo;s what I learn.\nReference: https://www.chromforum.org/viewtopic.php?t=22478\nCase #02 #  Situation:\nJetStream ESI Agilent 6470a coupled with Agilent 1260 Infiniti.\nThe signal is completely gone. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where the liquid comes from in mass-spec - from HPLC, through the tuning line or directly from the syringe - the effect is the same - zero signal. Tuning mixture, chloramphenicol, reserpine, polytyrosine - nothing is detected.\nAt the same time, the nebulizer forms a good spray. What could be the problem?\nP.S. It is interesting that the capillary current does not change much and, regardless of the presence or absence of a spray, it remains about 2000 nA. Could this be an isolator problem?\nSolution:\nDid you check the Vchamber and Vcap? Did you try to replace the capillary?\nCase #03 #  Situation:\n  single quad, and sorry forgot the details.

If your spray chamber settings are okay, you have verified that a sufficient amount tuning mix makes it to the nebulizer and you\u0026rsquo;re using a fresh bottle of the correct mix, then I would also make that the corona needle is clean and sharp, the nebulizer is adjusted correctly and the spray shield is clean.

My laboratory has been using SCIEX 6500 triple Quad and recently acquired Thermo TSQ Quantiva triple quad. We have established many methods in SCIEX that worked satisfactorily and now trying to transfer the method established in 6500 to Quantiva. However, I have been having unstable signal problems in optimizing the condition in TSQ Quantiva.\nThe system I am using is a Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC and TSQ Quantiva triple quad. I have already tuned my compounds in Quantiva and manual tuning by infusing the standard compounds into the MS seems normal with stable signal of RSD\u0026lt;15%. However, when I tried to setup the whole program with LC and MRM conditions, the signals of all my target analytes fluctuates, say every 5-10 injections, there would be one injection that the signals of all analytes became nearly half. But when I tried to do replicate injections of reserpine, everything seems alright.\nI have checked the UPLC part but the flow rate, pressure, etc looks normal. I have also cleaned the source, needles etc, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t improve much. Previously I have got relatively more stable signal with the same conditions for my target analytes, but then after doing replicate injections for nearly 60 times, the instrument never became stable again. I have tried all the other analytes that worked previously but still everything went unstable except reserpine.\nI have been encountering this problem for several months but still cannot solve it.\nSolution:\nThe injections that are fluctuating; are those injections of solvent standards or samples?\nWhen transferring the method, did you take into account that the SCIEX 6500 is a more sensitive instrument than the Quantiva? Maybe you are trying to measure at a level that is just to low for the quantiva?\nPoint: concentration is too low.\r Solution: Our lab recently got a Quantiva. We started having issues where we would get a linear curve at low concentrations and it would bend over at higher concentrated standards.\nIm not sure if this is relatable or not, but what fixed this issue was recalibrating the electron multiplier.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard from thermo techs that the Quantiva detector isn\u0026rsquo;t the greatest, it needs \u0026lsquo;broken in\u0026rsquo; and furthermore, it will probably need replaced yearly. But I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that your Quantiva is new, and I would try recalibrating the multiplier monthly.\nHope this might help.\nEDIT: just extra stuff I was thinking about. With our Quantiva, we have to clean the ion transfer tube like every 3 days. It makes a HUGE difference in signal strength. It\u0026rsquo;s actually really frustrating. They made the transfer tube different in this model (wayyy bigger orifice (to try and get more ions into the detector?)) and it totally wasn\u0026rsquo;t an improvement.\nI personally don\u0026rsquo;t recommend the Quantiva for the above reasons, we have multiple TSQ Vantage from thermo and they work more reliably than this new instrument with the same sensitivity.\nPoint: recalibrate the electron multiplier\r Solution:\nWe have been recalibrating the EM once every three months. But the signal is still unstable even after the reaclibration. Our ion tube has to be cleaned quite often too, even when we were now just injecting pure standard for stability checking.\nRecently it was found that the signal became stable when the divert valve is not used to divert sample to waste, i.e. all samples go directly to MS. When diverting the early eluting portion to waste, the signal became unstable. The divert valve has been replaced twice and didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to solve the problem.\nPoint: divert valve is tricky\r Solution: You mentioned earlier that using the divert valve early in the run seemed to introduce the variability. Does your gradient include acetonitrile or source use the fused silica sample tube?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve had problems in the past on a Quantum with the fused silica drying out during the run (with a divert valve and heat on) and the polyimide coating \u0026ldquo;growing\u0026rdquo; out of the needle causing unstable spray. Replacing that with the stainless sample tube stopped the required weekly trim.\nPoint: the divert valve\r Solution:\nproblems like this can be solved by making sure that all the basic things - fresh standards, clean spray shields, sometimes salt buildup on other parts of the ion-source, etc. - are taken care of. Then you might have to dig deeper, so maybe it\u0026rsquo;s time to get in touch with a service engineer.\nPoint: fresh standards, clean spray shields, builtup salt.\r Reference:\nhttps://www.chromforum.org/viewtopic.php?t=49674\n"},{"id":49,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-02-Practices/Noisy_baseline/","title":"Noisy Baseline","section":"Part II Practices","content":"Situation\nThe attached picture is the baseline from an injection of blank ACN into 2.1x100 mm BEH column.

But when we initiated subject sample analysis, one of the analyte is showing variation in response due to which 4 subjects out of 12 analysed until now need to be repeated due to results for this analyte is not within batch acceptance criteria. There are total 64 subjects to be analysed. We have checked all possibilities for this response variation but there is no change.\nI think there is some change in the LC-MS/MS parameter for this molecule; therefore I want to know can I tune or optimize the LC-MS/MS parameters for this molecule in-between the analysis and continue further analysis of remaining subject after carrying out a PA batch in partial method validation or how to go about it.\nSolution #01\nI recommend to do an infusion test to determine the extent of the problem. Apparently, you have an ionization effect, therefore by infusing your drugs of interest along with the internal standards and injecting a QC sample versus a clinical sample, you will be able to see any ionization differences with time (maybe 30 minutes is sufficient). This will allow you to demonstrate the method is functioning properly (or not) without consuming a high volume of the clinical samples.\nFrom past experience, I expect that modifying the gases will not solve your problem.\nSolution #02\n  What internal standard are you using: stable-labelled, structural analogue, other ?\nA1: No, internal standard is not stable-labelled, structural analogue, but the internal standard response throughout analysis is reproducible with excellent % CV.\nB1: Which is actually a problem: your IS noes not mimic the analyte and therefore does not compensate for the variability you observe.\n  What type of sample preparation are you using: protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, solid phase extraction ?\nA1: sample preparation is by liquid-liquid extraction method.\n  Any \u0026ldquo;strange result\u0026rdquo; in the validation ?\nA1: No, method validation was extremely smooth and satisfactory with hardly 3 to 4 QCs out of acceptance criteria throughout validation.\n  What do you mean by \u0026ldquo;variation in response\u0026rdquo; of the analyte: do you mean that for your QC samples, for a same concentration you get a very different response for the analyte, while the response for the internal standard is stable ? And how much \u0026ldquo;variation\u0026rdquo; do you see ?\nA1: Variation in response means in system suitability test (prepared in matrix) first five injection shows reproducible response but the sixth injection shows different response for only that analyte while another analyte and IS shows good reproducibility. Similar results are observed during subject analysis after 4 to 5 injections there is change in response for that particular analyte and due to which we have to reject the batch (e.g. in cc and QC sample shows accuracy of 70 or 140 % for any of the in-between standard/QC sample).\nB1: This looks like your ion source needs some injections to stabilise. May be due to matrix effects (endogenous components accumulating on the column and getting released gradually thereafter) or due to a sort of conditioning. Does the response still vary afterwards, or does it get stable (but at a different level) after these first 5-10 (or more) injections ? If it does get stable afterwards, you may need to start your run with some injections of blank samples, and pay attention if there is an interruption in your run and you resume injections after some time.\nA2: We have carried out matrix effect during validation and also for bulk cc and QC sample preparation for subject analysis which was satisfactory for all analytes and IS. We had to inject at least 25 SST injections to stabilize the system before injecting six injection for the analysis batch which was not the case during method validation.\nIf there is interruption in run it should have effected the response for another analyte also which is not seen here.\nB2: True. But matrix effects are tested on a limited number of injections, and accumulating effects may not be visible during the validation.\nNo. Whatever the cause for your problem, ionisation is an analyte-specific issue. You may have problems with one analyte and not with the other. This is actually your case: you have problems with one analyte, but not with the internal standard.\n  What LC/MS/MS parameter do you plan to change ?\nA1: I planning to change slightly Source parameters of LC/MS/MS and not the compound parameters because I think gases need to be optimized.\nB1: This could indeed improve the situation, and just running a P\u0026amp;A run could be acceptable. However if you saw no problem during your initial validation, there are chances the P\u0026amp;A run will pass too. How do you plan to make sure that your new parameters will improve the situation, before you re-start sample analysis ?\nA2: I am planning to optimize instrument parameters (Gases) and observe the response for both analyte and IS by injecting SST solution, if the system gates stable in minimum number of injections, I will analyze one PA batch in PMV and then proceed for subject analysis.\nI want to know can I continue with subject analysis from no 13 as I have already analysed 12 out of which 4 needs to be repeated or I will have to start from first subject as instrument parameters will change from 13th subject.\nB2: As you have a clearly identified analytical issue I would re-analyse all samples after optimisation, if the situation improves. Will you be doing incurred sample reanalysis ? If some subject samples are affected also in the runs you have validated so far, you may end up failing ISR. Better be on the safe side, if you still have enough samples.\n  Reference\nhttps://forum.bebac.at/mix_entry.php?id=5337#p5337\n"},{"id":51,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-05-Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting_LCMSMS/","title":"Troubleshooting Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry in the Clinical Laboratory","section":"Part V LC-MS Troubleshooting","content":" Troubleshooting Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry in the Clinical Laboratory\n"},{"id":52,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-05-Troubleshooting/Troubleshooting_strategy/","title":"Troubleshooting strategy","section":"Part V LC-MS Troubleshooting","content":"sensitivity change\nmake new mobile phase A with pH modifier(aqeuous solution) rational: the pH promote the charged state of the analyte over its neutral species. mobile phase was contaminated attributing to rising baselines, noise or spikes.\nchromatography:\nTroubleshooting strategy:\n isolate area.

The maximum acceptable value for dwell time is 100 ms whereas my GC peak width is 5 s, is it mean that signal is recorded only for 100 ms of my GC peak? What is the exact meaning of dwell time in SIM mode?\nThanks\n ZeroUnderOne Maybe someone can correct me if I am wrong. The dwell time is how long the instrument hones in on a specific ion before switching to next then cycling back. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you are looking at 4 different ions in one segment, the dwell time would be how long it looks at ion 1 before switching to ion 2 then 3 then 4 then back to 1. Setting a proper dwell time will give you a nice looking peak as it determines how many data points you will have over the time width of the peak. If you peak time is 5 seconds then you calculate dwell time as follows.\n5s x1000 = 5000ms 5000ms /20 data points over the peak = 250 ms 250ms / 4 different ions = 62.5 ms\nYour dwell time would thus be 62.5 ms for each of those ions in the segment. I chose 20 data points because that typically gives a nice and smooth peak.\nHope that helps.\n James_Ball\nThat is correct, the dwell is how long it pauses at each ion before looking at the next. There is also a little overhead from the switching process which adds maybe another ms per ion. I normally run about 50ms each with up to about 8 ions in a group which will still be in the 2 scans per second range similar to my full scan methods.\n ZeroUnderOne Thanks for answering\nSo, dwell time has no effect on intensity of SIM signal? As I know, in quadrupole analyzer sensitivity in SIM mode is decreased by increasing the number of selected ion to determine. But it seems, by choosing the proper dwell time I don\u0026rsquo;t lost sensitivity by increasing the number of ions.\nLets consider two situations: 1- I have one ion to detected in a time segment, so 100 ms dwell time means each 100 ms, one data point is recorded. 2- I have two ions to detected in a time segment, so 100 ms dwell time for each ion means each 200 ms, one data point is recorded (so the shape of peak in this situation must be lower quality than situation 1).\nAs each ion detected for 100 ms, sensitivity in situation 1 \u0026amp; 2 seems to be the same whereas in situation 2 sensitivity must be lower because two ions are detected, is it correct?\n James_Ball Sensitivity for each ion is relative to the dwell time for that specific ion, to some extent. If you have two ions and you dwell on one for 5ms and the other for 100ms, odds are the first ion could have lower sensitivity, if both ions have the same abundance normally.\nI have a method that has over 100 compounds, which would be impossible to make enough segments to have only 5-8 masses per segment, so I have more masses and only dwell for 20-50ms. For the internal standards which I know will have high abundance in the chromatogram I dwell for as short of time as possible, sometimes as low as 10ms, where for compounds that have poor response I will dwell for longer. So I may have a segment with 10 masses that have dwell times of 10ms for an internal standard compound and 30ms for compounds that respond well and maybe a 60ms dwell on a compound that responds poorly. Then the next segment may have everything set to 100ms dwell because they are all very poor response compounds, then another with all 40ms dwell. I try to make each of my segments so that the entire set is reading at a rate of about 2 replicates per second, or a total dwell time of 500ms or less for the masses in each segment.\nIn the Agilent systems the dwell is set for each individual mass not per segment, so you can use that to adjust the sensitivity per mass to what you need. If you dwell to short of time you do not get good reproduceability and your peaks may look rough. If you dwell too long you can saturate the detector and also have poor quality peaks. You have to adjust each mass to achieve the quality and sensitivity you want for your specific analysis. It takes a little time to get everything where you like it, but if you watch keep the total cycle time at about 2 replicates per second you should have nice quality peaks with a normal capillary column.\n jerole Hi alcorn,\nThe Agilent GC-MS instruments have a fixed integration time (the time they are accumulating counts). I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the exact value, but lets assume it is 0.1 ms. The dwell time is the time it repeats that process, for example a dwell time of 10 ms means that it accumulates counts 100 times (dwell time/integration time) and then it averages the result. Therefore, the dwell time should have no influence on the sensitivity, 1ms or 100ms dwell time will result in the same counts. Higher dwell times will only improve your precision, not the sensitivity. Though, high dwell times might result in a loss of sensitivity if you measure too many ions resulting in less than 4 cycles/s and not well defined peaks, you might miss the max of the peak. My recommendation is to adjust the dwell time depending on the number of ions per segment to obtain at least 4 cycles/s.\nJ\n mckrause No, Jerole, that is not correct. James is correct; in SIM mode the dwell time is the amount of time (up to a limit) that the system stays set to pass a certain mass. Counting by the EM is cumulative.\nIt does affect your sensitivity; unfortunately, it is not a linear function. You don\u0026rsquo;t double your sensitivity by setting the dwell time to 20 ms rather than 10 ms, so you can\u0026rsquo;t always predict the increase in sensitivity for a given compound.\nOne of the keys to good quantification in SIM mode is making sure you get enough data points across the peak, so make sure that your total dwell time for any given ion set is not so large as to only give you a handful of datapoints across your peak. I know that for us this can be an issue as we routinely see 3-4 second peaks, so we typically keep our total dwell time down around 100-200 ms.\n chemstation Dear mckrause, Jerole is correct for AGILENT GCMSD, maybe other manufacturers do it as textbooks explain it to be, but Agilent does not.\nThis was confirmed a long time ago when I had tried to increase the linear range quantitation of a targeted analysis of a dichloro containing compound, with samples of unknown and varying concentrations.\nI had created a method for quantitation, and had set a low dwell time for the M+4 isotope with the theory that concentrated samples won\u0026rsquo;t saturate the EM, and a long dwell time for the M ion so as to quantitate low concentration samples.\nThis did not work, as I keep getting the same ion counts. When I discussed this with a knowledgeable Agilent Technician, he confirmed what Jerole had written. That for an Agilent GCMSD, increasing dwell time only increases the signal to electronic noise ratio, it does not change the ion counts measured.\nWhich is why Agilent instruments can run Scan and SIM in the same method, and I had to split the column eluent to different detectors to increase the range of quantitation.\nregards Alex\n jerole\nFrom the MassHunter help file:\n Dwell Time\nDwell time is the product of sample number and integration time. To increase signal a fixed integration time of 235 us is used for SIM data in Acquisition and the tune file set for Integr is ignored.\n I had the same discussion with a Prof. at the local University. He ran the same standard with increasing dwell times from 1 ms up to 100 ms and he got the same response in all cases.\nAs I wrote in the previous note, this is the case for the Agilent instrument and most likely it will be different for instruments of other manufacturers. The meaning of dwell time and/or integration time varies depending on the manufacturer.\n alcorn If it is correct that higher dwell time (so what sufficient data points are gathered) has no effect on sensitive in SIM, why sensitivity is decreased by increasing number of detected ions in SIM?\nThe only thing that differs is \u0026ldquo;collecting time\u0026rdquo; (so called dwell time) of each ion, which decreases when number of ions is increased in SIM.\nAny idea?\n James_Ball\nI am doing a lot of SIM methods now the Agilent GC/MS, and what I am finding is that increasing dwell really doesn\u0026rsquo;t increase response, but it does increase the sampling which gives a better average when the signal is processed. A smoother average will give a smoother peak which when the peak smoothing is applied can give a larger response.\nOn the ABI Sciex 3200 if I increase the smoothing I actually get lower response peaks because it is throwing away some response as it smooths the peak to a better average. Every instrument does it a little differently.\n Imh\nThe debate really comes down to whether the result of a SIM event is reported in \u0026ldquo;total ions counted\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ions per second\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you make a series of ten 1msec measurements and average them, you\u0026rsquo;re reporting \u0026ldquo;ions per msec\u0026rdquo;, but you counted exactly the same number of ions, in total, as you would have, had you merely carried out a single 10msec event. The effect of SIM dwell time on precision is exactly the same in both cases.\nUnder the hood, Agilent might make a series of measurements and average them, or count all the ions over x msec dwell-time and divide the result by x; it would be impossible to tell which approach they\u0026rsquo;d used, because they\u0026rsquo;re mathematically identical. Only an Agilent engineer knows the truth!\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter whether a system reports total ions, or ions per msec, but I have a slight preference for the latter, because it makes comparison of different, related species slightly more intuitive, and the absolute calibration curves are a little more independent of dwell-time. On the other hand, someone else will quite reasonably prefer to see total ions per event, because it reveals better whether the signal is adequate, or whether the dwell times need a bit of shuffling to get better quality measurements.\nReference\nhttps://www.chromforum.org/viewtopic.php?t=27935\n"},{"id":55,"href":"/docs/05-Mass-Spec/Part-1-Theory/HRMS_table/","title":"HRMS List","section":"Part I Theory","content":"series: [Applications in High Resolution Mass Spectrometrey Food Safety and Pesticide Residue Analysis edited by Roberto Romero-Gonzalez]\nTable : Overview of the Technical Specifications and Characteristics of Time-of-Flight (TOF) and Orbitrap FWHM, full width at half maximum;\nHDMS, high-definition mass spectrometry;\nIT-TOF, ion trap time-of-flight;\nLTQ-Orbitrap, linear ion trap Orbitrap.\nReproduced from Royal Society of Chemistry with permission, Copyright 2015 [Lin, L., Lin, H., Zhang, M., Dong, X., Yin, X., Qu, C. et al.

Thus, substances that were not originally sought can be detected by revisiting the data. This is not possible in the case of the SIM technique, which operates on the principle of the selection of previously known substance and characteristic ions.\nGC single ion trap MS [2] #  Disadvantages of GC-MS using original 3D QITs were related to space charge problems, leading to lower mass resolution and mass shifts and ion/molecule reactions called \u0026ldquo;self-CI.\u0026rdquo; Although modern instruments have various techniques to prevent overfilling of the trap, this can still be a problem when analyzing pesticides at low levels in dirty matrices because the trap is filled with ions derived from matrix leaving little space for the small number of analyte ions. The limited storage of ions has also limited the dynamic range of the 3D QIT.\nIon trap vs. single quadrupole [2] #  Both single quadrupole and 3D QIT work at unit mass resolution, selectivity is limited, so these instruments can suffer from reduced sensitivity due to the contribution to the analyte signal from chemical noise.\nIOn trap tandem MS [3] #  The capability of the 3D QIT to store ions of a single m/z value to the exclusion of ions of all other m/z values allows for MS/MS by means of collision-induced dissociation (CID) within a single mass analyzer. An ion can be stored as a precursor, and that stored ion can then be manipulated to collide with the cooling gas molecules to produce product ions. By ramping the RF voltage, or by applying supplementary voltages on the end cap electrodes, or by combination of both, it is possible to keep only one ion in the trap, fragment it by inducing vibrations, and observe the fragments as they are sequentially ejected from the trap.\nThe high efficiency for ion-trap MS/MS results from the parent and product ions remaining in a single ion trap and not transported from one chamber to another, eliminating transport losses. The application of wideband excitation (activation) and normalized collision energy leads to highly reproducible mass spectra. Hence, the main advantage of using a 3D QIT for GC-MS/MS is that full product ion spectra can be generated from trace amounts of pesticides for comparison with MS/MS libraries.\nThe primary advantage of 3D QIT is that multiple MS/MS experiments can be performed quickly without having multiple analyzers. Hence, the introduction of MS/MS on a 3D QIT was a major breakthrough as it brought down the cost of tandem mass spectrometry. Unlike MRM using a triple quadrupole, however, MS/MS using 3D QIT is restricted to concurrent acquisition of a limited number of precursor ions.\nReferences #  [1] p69, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

For example, the integer atomic mass of bromine is 80 Da. This is because there are only two naturally occurring stable isotopes of bromine, 79Br and 81Br, which exist in nature in about equal amounts. When the relative mass (Mr) of an ion, molecule, or radical is reported, it is based on the atomic masses of its elements.\n• Nominal mass: Mass of a molecular ion or molecule calculated using the isotope mass of the most abundant constituent element isotope of each element rounded to the nearest integer value and multiplied by the number of atoms of each element. Example: nominal mass of H2O = (2 $\\times$ 1 + 1 $\\times$ 16) u = 18 u.\n• Monoisotopic mass: Exact mass of an ion or molecule calculated using the mass of the most abundant isotope of each element. Example: monoisotopic mass of H2O = (2 $\\times$ 1.007825 + 1 $\\times$ 15.994915) u = 18.010565 u. The exact mass of the common elements and their isotopes are provided in Table 1.1.\n• Exact mass: Calculated mass of an ion or molecule with specified isotopic composition.\n• Mass defect: Difference between the nominal mass and the monoisotopic mass of an atom, molecule, or ion. It can be a positive or negative value.\n• Relative isotopic mass defect (RΔm): It is the mass defect between the monoisotopic mass of an element and the mass of its A+1 or its A+2 isotopic cluster (Thurman \u0026amp; Ferrer, 2010). For instance, RDm for the pair 35Cl:37Cl is 0.0030 Da.\n• Average mass: Mass of an ion or molecule weighted for its isotopic composition, i.e., the average of the isotopic masses of each element, weighted for isotopic abundance (Table 1.1).

(1)\nExact mass: It is the calculated mass of an ion whose elemental formula, isotopic composition and charge state are known, i.e., it is the theoretical mass. The IUPAC definition constricts the definition to using one isotope of each atom involved, usually the lightest isotope, but generalizes the definition to cover an ion or neutral molecule (2). The charge state is relevant as the mass of the electron (0.00055 Da), or multiple charges, may not be negligible in the context of mass measurement.\nA mass spectrum can be annotated with its nominal masses or accurate masses, to an appropriate number of significant figures. The IUPAC unit of mass is the unified mass unit (u) (2) and is also referred to as the Dalton (Da) although this is not an SI unit. The term atomic mass unit (amu) is a redundant unit although it is still in wide use.\nA mass spectrometer measures mass-to-charge, and m/z should normally be used when referring to the mass scale.\nAccuracy and Precision #  Accuracy: The proximity of the experimental measurement to the true value (exact mass). When a measurement is close to the true value we say it is accurate and when it is not we say it is inaccurate.\nNormally, mass measurement error would be used to describe the accuracy of a single reading.\nPrecision: The repeatability of the measurement reflecting random errors. Random errors cause measurements to fall on either side of the average experimental measurement and affect the precision of the set of measurements. When a set of mass measurements of one ion species lie close together we say the measurements are precise, and when not we say the measurements are imprecise.\nTwo other items of terminology which must be clarified are:\nRepeatability: This is the short-term precision of multiple replicate experimental measurements made under similar conditions, i.e., the same instrument, operator and over a limited time, normally the same day. Reproducibility: It refers to differences among experimental measurements made under different circumstances i.e., a measurement of the same quantity made by different operators, even different instruments and often with a significant time difference between groups of measurements.\nEstimation of Mass Measurement Statistics #  The mass measurement error (or accuracy) of a single reading will be:\n$Δm_i = (m_i - m_a)$ in Da\n$ = (m_i - m_a) \\times 10^3$ in mDa\n$ = \\frac{(m_i - m_a)}{m_a} \\times 10^6$ in ppm\nThe symbol ma has been used here to represent exact mass as the symbol me represents the electron mass and the symbol mex could be interpreted as experimental mass and not exact mass.\nThe term “error” is defined as the difference between an individual measurement and the true value, where $\\Delta$mi can be positive or negative.\nIt is important to remember that the term “error” should only be used in connection with the result of a single measurement and not used to represent an averaged measurement (see later discussion).\nErrors in relation to the exact mass measurement are only apparent when the compound’s composition is known.\nThe term “mass deviation” has been proposed to the proteomics community for reporting a single mass measurement error. These authors define mass deviation as “the measured mass minus the calculated mass,” and recommend this instead of using “mass accuracy”. Whilst it is correct to point out that the term accuracy should not be used for a single measurement, there is no necessity to redefine this as deviation. In fact, IUPAC defines deviation as “the difference between an observed value and the arithmetic mean of the set to which it belongs.” This is not the same definition as that for the error of a measurement, which IUPAC defines as “the result of a measurement minus the true value.” Thus, the term mass deviation is not appropriate to describe a mass measurement error. They further define the term maximum mass deviation (MMD), “this is the cutoff value used in database search. Only peptide sequences with a calculated mass within this tolerance are reported as hits.”\nppm error is a quantity frequently used to report mass errors and varies along the mass scale.\nA simple way to indicate the accuracy of measurement is the use of the significant figure convention. For example, if experience and observation of mass measurements showed measurements to give ~0.001 Da accuracy, then the mass would be reported to one more significant figure.\nFigure : Illustration of the meaning of the terms accuracy, precision, average experimental mass and calculated exact mass of a dataset. (a) Histogram (plotted for convenience as a continuous probability curve) showing accuracy i.e., the difference between the calculated exact mass (reference quantity) and the measured average mass (experimental quantity). Precision is a measure of the spread of mass measurements of the dataset, and relate to the repeatability of the measurements undertaken.

For peaks of similar height separated by a valley, let the height of the valley at its lowest point be 10% of the lower peak, and the resolution should be given for a number of values of m/z.

The used fraction is often 50%, and Δ(m/z) is named as full width at half maximum (FWHM).

It was a trapping device consisting of a charged wire stretched along the axis of an enclosed metal can. The wire establishes an electrostatic field within the can, and ions that possess sufficiently high tangential velocity orbit the wire, rather than directly colliding with it (Eliuk \u0026amp; Makarov, 2015, p. 61).\nA thorough explanation of the mass analysis process is detailed elsewhere (Eliuk \u0026amp; Makarov, 2015, p. 61). This mass analyzer is based on the confinement of ions in an electrostatic potential well (Makarov, 1999, US 5886346; Makarov, 2000, p. 1156; Makarov \u0026amp; Hardman, 2006, US 6998609 B2) created between two carefully shaped electrodes: an inner coaxial spindled-shaped electrode and an outer (barrellike) electrode, which is actually composed of two symmetrical halves electrically isolated from each other, set out for two purposes: establishment of the ion trapping fields and as receiver plates for image-current detection.\nFigure : Cross section of the C-trap ion accumulation device and the Orbitrap mass analyzer with an example of an ion trajectory. During the voltage ramp, the ion packets enter the Orbitrap mass analyzer forming rings that induce current which is detected by the amplifier.\rThe electrodes are precisely machined so that the electrostatic attractions of the ions to inner electrode are finely balanced by centrifugal forces, which cause the ions to orbit around the spindle. Previously, ions are first accumulated on an external injecting device (C-trap) that traps the ions in gas-filled quadrupole being then injected tangentially into the mass analyzer in short pulses (Fig.). Besides, an axial field causes the ions to oscillate harmonically along the spindled-shaped electrode. The outer electrodes allow differential image-current detection. These image currents produced by the oscillating ions are detected, followed by a fast Fourier transform (FT) to convert the time-domain signal to frequency domain and then to m/z spectrum. Here the resolution is directly proportional to number of harmonic oscillations detected. The resolving power can be enhanced by increasing the gap between inner and outer electrodes providing higher field strength for a given voltage. As the maximum acquisition time is limited in Orbitrap, the resolution power is not as high as FT-ICR. However, commercial Orbitrap analyzer provides a nominal resolution power as high as 500,000 at FWHM. p21, Applications in High Resolution Mass Spectrometrey Food Safety and Pesticide Residue Analysis, edited by Roberto Romero-González, ©2017 ELSEVIER.\n"},{"id":61,"href":"/docs/05-Mass-Spec/Part-1-Theory/QToF/","title":"QToF","section":"Part I Theory","content":"series: [Applications in High Resolution Mass Spectrometrey Food Safety and Pesticide Residue Analysis edited by Roberto Romero-Gonzalez]\nTable : Key elements of modern Quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer FWHM, full width at half maximum;\nHDMS, high-definition mass spectrometry;\nIT-TOF, ion trap time-of-flight;\nLTQ-Orbitrap, linear ion trap Orbitrap.\nRReprinted with permission from Elsevier, Copyright © 2016 [Fjeldsted, J.C.

Tadeo]\nSingle Quadrupole Analyzer 1 #  The quadrupole consists of four parallel metal rods. Each opposing rod pair is connected together electrically and a radio-frequency (RF) voltage is applied between one pair of rods and the other. A direct current (DC) voltage is then superimposed on the RF voltage. Ions travel down the quadrupole in between the rods. Only ions of a certain m/z will reach the detector for a given ratio of voltages, other ions have unstable trajectories and will collide with the rods. This allows selection of a particular ion, or scanning by varying the voltages.\nThe quadrupole can be used in two modes: scan or single ion monitoring (SIM), also called single ion recording (SIR). In scan mode, the amplitude of the DC and RF voltages are ramped (while keeping a constant RF/DC ratio), to obtain the mass spectrum over the required mass range. Sensitivity is a function of the scanned mass range, the scan speed, and resolution. In SIM mode, the parameters (amplitude of the DC and RF voltages) are set to observe only a specific mass, or to \u0026ldquo;jump\u0026rdquo; between a selection of specific masses. The SIM mode provides the highest sensitivity but users are restricted to acquiring specific ions, typically EI fragments, since more time, the dwell time, can be spent on each mass. A longer dwell time would result in better sensitivity but, the number of data points acquired across a single peak, and the total number of pesticides that could be analyzed in a single run, are reduced. Due to insufficient sensitivity in scan mode, historically, quadrupoles have typically been operated in SIM for optimum sensitivity, limiting the amount of structural information that could be recorded.\nSIM can suffer from isobaric interference.\nSingle Quadrupole vs. Tandem Mass Spectrometry #  As both single quadrupole and 3D QIT work at unit mass resolution, selectivity is limited, so these instruments can suffer from reduced sensitivity due to the contribution to the analyte signal from chemical noise. Although low reporting limits might be possible for simple matrices using GC-MS, these instruments can provide insufficient selectivity for complex food matrices. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), in which mass-selected ions are subjected to a second mass spectrometric analysis, can provide increased selectivity, which reduces the contribution to the analyte signal from isobaric interference leading to improvements in sensitivity. 68 Hence, lower limits of detection become achievable when using GC-MS/MS for pesticide residue analysis in complex matrices. The same selectivity, achieved by monitoring the transition from one parent ion to a characteristic product ion, provides a greater degree of confidence for confirmation of identity than SIM, which can suffer from isobaric interferences.\nBased on the current EU quality control procedures for pesticide residue analysis, if using GC-MS, four ions have to be detected and all ion ratios have to be within the specified tolerance intervals for identity to be confirmed. Additional legislation directed at residues of substances in live animals and animal products introduced an identification point (IP) system that was weighted to the selectivity of the method used. When using the more selective MS/MS technique, monitoring and detection of two transitions exhibiting a ratio within tolerance is sufficient, as the precursor earns 1 point and each product ion earns 1.5 points, 4 points in total. The IP system has been applied to the determination of pesticide residues in animal products and may find wider usage.\n  p68, p70, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

The first quadrupole is used in SIM mode to select a first ion (precursor), which is fragmented in the collision cell. This is typically achieved in the collision cell by accelerating the ions in the presence of a collision gas. The energy of the collision with the gas can be varied to allow different degrees of fragmentation. The resulting fragments are analyzed by the second quadrupole and also typically used in SIM mode to monitor a specific fragment (product), the process known as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) (also called selected reaction monitoring, SRM). As two analyzers increase the selectivity, the ion signal is reduced during the transmission, but the chemical noise, which is a major limitation for complex samples, is also largely decreased, leading to an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio.\n  p70, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

The more energetic the ion, the deeper it penetrates the retarding field of the reflection before getting reflected. This allows an energetic ion, traveling a longer flight path, to arrive at the detector at the same time as the less energetic ions of the same mass. detects at trace levels while retaining full spectral information.  The use of TOF technology provides an innovative approach to overcoming the drawbacks that limit the exploitation of mass spectrometers for detecting pesticides at trace levels while retaining full spectral information as a tool for confirmation of identity. The design of the orthogonal acceleration (oa) TOF, into which pulses of ions are extracted orthogonally from a continuous ion beam, the availability of fast-recording electronics, together with improvements in signal deconvolution techniques, were major breakthroughs in the development of modern GC-TOF instruments.\nAs the name implies, separation of ions in a TOF mass analyzer is accomplished by measuring their flight time in a field-free tube based on the fact that ion velocity is mass-dependent. The ions generated in an EI source are initially accelerated to get discrete packages with a constant kinetic energy, which are ejected into the mass analyzer using pulsed electric field gradient oriented orthogonally to the ion beam. Reflectrons (ion mirrors) are used to compensate for variations in initial energy distribution. Ions are reflected based on their forward kinetic energy. The more energetic the ion, the deeper it penetrates the retarding field of the reflection before getting reflected. This allows an energetic ion, traveling a longer flight path, to arrive at the detector at the same time as the less energetic ions of the same mass.\nIons are detected using a multichannel plate detector (MCP) and detection of \u0026ldquo;ion events\u0026rdquo; converted from an analog signal to a digital record. Flight times, which are proportional to the square root of the m/z value of an ion, are in the order of microseconds. Consequently, TOF MS can operate at very high repetition rates and between 20 and 500 spectra per second can be stored. The effort to exploit these unique features has resulted in the development of two types of commercial spectrometers differing in their basic characteristics: 1) instruments using unit-resolution instruments that feature a high acquisition speed and 2) elevated resolution analyzers with only moderate acquisition speed. The application potential of these approaches is obviously complementary. Both approaches are characterized by high sensitivity due to improved mass analyzer efficiency and continuous acquisition of full range mass spectra. Mass analyzer efficiency of the TOF-MS instruments is as high as 25% in full spectra acquisition (quadrupole 0.1%).\nGeneration of complete mass spectra from residues of pesticides even at trace levels enables searching against library reference spectra for identification. The fast repetition rate ensures that no changes in the ratios of analyte ions across the peak occur during the acquisition of the mass spectrum and, consequently, no spectral skew, which is commonly observed by scanning instruments, is encountered. The generation of full range mass spectra also provides the ability to review archived data for new compounds outside the scope of the initial analysis. For example, in response to an EU Rapid Alert in late December 2006, those laboratories within the EU using GC-TOF MS were able to look back again at historical data and identify residues of isofenphos-methyl even though no routine government testing program in any EU member state had included tests for isofenphos-methyl at that time.\nHigh-speed TOFs, operating at unit mass resolution but with very fast scan rates (e.g., 500 spectra/s), can provide the data density necessary to accurately define narrow chromatographic peaks typical for fast and ultrafast GC and GCxGC. The high data acquisition rate and the absence of any spectral skew allow overlapping signals to be automatically deconvoluted based on their mass spectra.\nThe GC-TOF instruments with elevated resolution (typically 5000–7000 FWHM) and good mass accuracy (e.g., 5 ppm RMS) have so far had a more limited application to the analysis of pesticide residues. The elevated resolution and good mass accuracy can be significantly used to reduce the contribution from isobaric interference by evaluating data with a narrow mass window (typically 50 mDa), which improves detectability of the analytes. Measurement of an accurate mass of a particular ion also provides additional information for confirmation of identity for target compound analysis and, more importantly, aids the assignment of unknown compounds based on calculation of their elemental composition.\nHigh mass accuracy is attainable by using a lock mass calibration procedure for which a reference compound is continuously supplied into the ion source during analysis. On the basis of a previously performed mass calibration over a given mass range and a defined exact mass of the reference ion (the lock mass), the values of all masses in the acquired spectra are automatic and continually corrected. Mass accuracy varies with ion intensity. Care is required when applying exact mass windows as if the window is set too narrow, peaks may be underestimated or missed altogether. It is possible to search for compounds of interest by measurement of exact mass and isotope pattern of fragment ions and compare with the accurate masses in the reference spectra. Using this approach, the identification of the analyte can be based not only on retention time and EI mass spectrum, but thanks to the exact mass measurement also on elemental composition. In addition, the measurement of exact mass may aid the identification of unknown compounds through the calculation of elemental composition. In practice, this is a very demanding task as EI spectra rarely exhibit a molecular ion so a good knowledge of the fragmentation mechanism is required.\nThe main disadvantage of the TOF as an analyzer for quantitative GC-MS is the limited linear dynamic range compared with conventional MS instrumentation. The analog signal from the ion detector is converted to a digital record by a fast analogto- digital (ADC)-based continuous averager, also called an integrating transient recorder (ITR). With an ITR, the ion rates can be increased so that many ions of the same m/z value arrive at the ion detector simultaneously. The result is an analog voltage pulse whose amplitude is approximately proportional to the number of ions in the pulse. An ADC samples the output waveform of the ion detector and periodically converts the measured analog voltage to a digital representation, which is sequentially stored in a digital memory to form a single record. Although the linear dynamic range of the ITR is limited to two orders of magnitude, it has been expanded to approximately four orders of magnitude by application of continuing improvements in both hardware and software features.\nWhile GC-MS, using EI with SIM on a single quadrupole, still provides the widest scope for pesticide residue analysis, GC-MS/MS and GC-TOF MS offer two unique solutions. However, both are still used by a few laboratories. Although initial purchase cost remains higher than conventional benchtop instruments, which may currently prohibit use within routine laboratories, both approaches offer considerable benefits and so usage is likely to grow.\n"},{"id":65,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-01-Theory/Fast_liquid_chromatography/","title":"Fast Liquid Chromatography","section":"Part I Theory","content":"According to the van Deemter equation, which describes the relationship between linear velocity (flow rate) and plate height (HETP or column efficiency), when the particle size decreases to \u0026lt;2.5 μm not only is there a significant gain in efficiency, but the efficiency does not diminish at increased flow rates or linear velocities.\nIn order to accurately and reproducibly integrate an analyte peak, the MS must have a sufficient acquisition rate to capture enough data points across the peak (\u0026gt;10 points/peak), requiring very short dwell times and interchannel delays on a triple quadrupole instrument or the fast spectral acquisition of the TOF analyzer and the software tools to handle the increased number of results.\np77, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

A mixture of compounds to be analyzed is injected into the GC where the mixture is vaporized. The gas mixture travels through a GC column, where the compounds are separated as they interact with the column and then enter the mass spectrometer for ionization and mass analysis.\nA number of problematic pesticides are prone to degradation in the GC injector, including phthalimide fungicides (e.g., captan), organochlorines (e.g., DDT and chlorothalonil), organophosphorus pesticides (e.g., dimethoate), and pyrethroids.\nThe major source of inaccuracy in pesticide residue analysis by GC-MS, especially with food, is related to the injection of coextractives from the sample, the so-called \u0026ldquo;matrix effect.\u0026rdquo; A buildup of coextractives in a GC inlet may lead to successive adverse changes in the performance of the chromatographic system such as the loss of analytes and peak tailing due to undesired interactions with active sites in the inlet and column. Analytes that give poor peak shapes or degrade have higher detection limits, are more difficult to identify and integrate, and are more prone to interferences than stable analytes that give narrow peaks. For susceptible analytes, significant improvements in peak quality are obtained when matrix components are present because they fill active sites, thus reducing analyte interactions. However, this can lead to problems with quantification. These matrix effects can produce an overestimation of the analyte concentration if calibration has been performed with standards in solvent. The presence of matrix effects should be evaluated for all tested analytes. There are a number of approaches for preventing, reducing, or compensating for the occurrence of matrix effects including the use of matrix-matched calibrants, which is recommended for the monitoring of pesticide residues within the European Union.\nChemical ionization (CI) gives better selectivity than EI for a limited number of specific compounds, which provides improvements in reporting limits. Negative chemical ionization (NCI) exhibits a high selectivity for \u0026ldquo;electrontrapping\u0026rdquo; compounds (e.g., halogen-containing and other heteroatomic compounds) and electron-deficient aromatic compounds. The sensitivity can be improved by two orders of magnitude compared with EI.\nEI typically produces large number of characteristic fragments, when acquired under standardized condition (70 eV).\nLC with Selected Detectors #  Many pesticides do not contain strong UV chromophores.\nAnalysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

Tadeo]\nPesticides #  A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances, natural or synthetic, formulated to control or repel any pest that competes with humans for food, destroys property, and spreads disease. The term pest includes insects, weeds, mammals, and microbes, among others. There are different classes of pesticides according to their type of use. The main pesticide groups are herbicides, used to kill weeds and other plants growing in places where they are unwanted; insecticides, employed to kill insects and other arthropods; and fungicides, used to kill fungi. Other types of pesticides are acaricides, molluscicides, nematicides, pheromones, plant growth regulators, repellents, and rodenticides. 1\nPesticides are defined by the United States Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as ‘‘any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or repelling any pest,’’ where pests are defined as organisms that may be deleterious to human or the environment, including vertebrates other than human, invertebrates, plants, fungi, and microorganisms. This gives rise to specific terms such as insecticides, acaricides, herbicides, fungicides, nematicides, and rodenticides. 2\nThree important molecular properties that determine if the pesticide will or will not be recovered and detected are polarity, volatility, and thermal lability.\nVolatility and thermal lability are important because they determine whether the pesticide can be determined by GC or not.\nPesticides are one of the most important tools in the protection of agricultural crops against weeds, pests, and diseases. 3\nMycotoxins #  Mycotoxins – from the Greek μύκης (mykes, mukos) “fungus” and the Latin toxicum “poison” – are a large and growing family of secondary metabolites and hence natural products produced by fungi, in particular by molds.\nThe most important classes of fungi responsible for these compounds are Alternaria, Aspergillus (multiple forms), Penicillium, and Stachybotrys. The biological activity of mycotoxins ranges from weak and/or sometimes positive effects such as antibacterial activity (e.g. penicillin derivatives derived from Penicillium strains) to strong mutagenic (e.g. aflatoxins, patulin), carcinogenic (e.g. aflatoxins), teratogenic, neurotoxic (e.g. ochratoxins), nephrotoxic (e.g. fumonisins, citrinin), hepatotoxic, and immunotoxic (e.g. ochratoxins, diketopiperazines) activities. 4\nMolds and fungi can produce carcinogenic mycotoxins, including ochratoxin A and aflatoxins.\n  Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

While the resulting extracts were not as clean as those obtained by the Mills method, both polar and nonpolar pesticides could be recovered.\nUsing the Mills method, water and NaCl are added to the sample extract, and pesticide residues are partitioned from the acetonitrile–water mixture into a very nonpolar solvent, petroleum ether.\nThe Mills method worked very well with the nonpolar OC pesticides. Some of the more polar OPs that were developed in the 1970s were not easily recovered.\nA number of methods have been presented that employ organic solvent extraction by shaking instead of using mechanical blenders or homogenizers.\nShaking may not work as well as homogenizing for some of the more nonpolar OCs.\nPolar solvents are needed for the extraction of nonpolar OC pesticides from the plant matrix.\nIn 2003, a new approach to the extraction of pesticides from fresh fruits and vegetables with acetonitrile, called quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) was reported. 1 This method entailed shaking the sample with acetonitrile, followed by shaking with sodium chloride (NaCl) and MgSO4 to remove the water. The salts create an exothermic reaction with water, induce phase separation between water and acetonitrile, and bind water to drive the pesticide analytes into the acetonitrile phase, resulting in high recoveries, including the polar and water-soluble pesticide, methamidophos. A modified QuEChERS extraction, using 1% acetic acid–acetonitrile extraction solvent and sodium acetate rather than NaCl, was developed to facilitate the recovery of base-sensitive fungicides like chlorothalonil and captan.\n“Luke method\u0026quot;. Produce samples were extracted with acetone, and water was removed from the extract by a series of liquid–liquid partition steps, first with petroleum ether–dichloromethane, followed by dichloromethane–NaCl. Both polar and nonpolar pesticides could be recovered.\nEthyl acetate is only slightly miscible with water, which simplifies the problem of separating water from the sample extract. Since ethyl acetate is more nonpolar than the other solvents discussed, the polar pesticides do not readily partition into ethyl acetate. Large amounts of sodium sulfate are usually added to bind the coextracted water and force the polar pesticides into the organic phase. Most methods using ethyl acetate extraction entail two extractions of the sample matrix rather than the single extraction commonly used with acetonitrile and acetone. Polar solvents like ethanol may be added to the extraction solvent to increase the recovery of polar compounds.

Tadeo]\nSPE Application [1] #  SPE is a cleanup technique. SPE columns are typically in the 10–50 theoretical plate range.\nTwo strategies have been used for SPE cleanup of sample extracts, which can be referred to as analyte isolation and matrix isolation. Analyte isolation typically entails analytes that are adsorbed from an organic solvent–water mixture onto a nonpolar SPE sorbent.\nThe SPE column may be rinsed with an aqueous solution to remove interfering coextractives, followed by elution of the adsorbed analytes with an organic solvent.\nMatrix isolation entails using the SPE columns which act as chemical filters and trapping matrix components while the pesticides are eluted through the column. Matrix isolation is more widely used in pesticide residue cleanup. Generally, matrix isolation SPE cleanup procedures are devised so that both polar and nonpolar pesticides will be eluted through the SPE column(s) while certain matrix components will be retained.\nAnalyte isolation using nonpolar reversed phase SPE columns (C18 or SDVB) works very well with nonpolar pesticides such as the OCs and the synthetic pyrethroids but not with polar, water-soluble pesticides, as they may not be consistently adsorbed onto nonpolar reversed phase SPE sorbents from an organic solvent–water mixture.\na C18, Octadecyl-derivatized silica; GCB, graphitized carbon black; NH2, aminopropyl; PSA, primary secondary amine; SAX, strong anion exchanger.\nb OH, Organohalogens; ON, organonitrogens; OP, organophosphates; PYR, synthetic pyrethroids; NMC, N-methylcarbamates.\nc DCM, dichloromethane; EtAc, ethyl acetate; PE, petroleum ether.\nDisadvantage [2] #  There are many different types of sorbents and configurations (e.g., mass of sorbent per tube), and each SPE is inherently best suited for a specific class of pesticide compounds. This, when combined with operational factors such as flow rate, conditioning, and elution, and the effect of sample matrix, can make the recovery of pesticides highly variable.\nIn addition, suspended solids and salts are known to cause blockage of SPE cartridges. Samples compatible with SPE must be relatively clean (e.g., groundwater). When surface water samples are analyzed, prefiltration is generally necessary to remove the suspended solids. This may not be desirable for hydrophobic compounds, because a significant fraction of the analyte is associated with the suspended solids.\nReference #  [1] p158, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, Jose L.

A number of problematic pesticides are prone to degradation in the GC injector, including phthalimide fungicides (e.g., captan), organochlorines (e.g., DDT and chlorothalonil), organophosphorus pesticides (e.g., dimethoate), and pyrethroids. The major source of inaccuracy in pesticide residue analysis by GC-MS, especially with food, is related to the injection of coextractives from the sample, the so-called \u0026ldquo;matrix effect\u0026rdquo;. A buildup of coextractives in a GC inlet may lead to successive adverse changes in the performance of the chromatographic system such as the loss of analytes and peak tailing due to undesired interactions with active sites in the inlet and column. Analytes that give poor peak shapes or degrade have higher detection limits, are more difficult to identify and integrate, and are more prone to interferences than stable analytes that give narrow peaks. For susceptible analytes, significant improvements in peak quality are obtained when matrix components are present because they fill active sites, thus reducing analyte interactions. However, this can lead to problems with quantification. These matrix effects can produce an overestimation of the analyte concentration if calibration has been performed with standards in solvent. The presence of matrix effects should be evaluated for all tested analytes. There are a number of approaches for preventing, reducing, or compensating for the occurrence of matrix effects including the use of matrix-matched calibrants, which is recommended for the monitoring of pesticide residues within the European Union.\nHPLC: no thermal degradation, very few surface activity issues, can do large-volume injection for lower detection limits.\nWith LC-MS/MS, sample clean-up is less crucial when compared with analysis by GC-MS/MS.\nChromatography #  GC:\nHPLC: HPLC can eliminate isobaric interferences and matrix effects that may affect the relative response of analytes.\nIon suppression is observed either from coelution with other analytes or, more likely, coeluting matrix components.\nReversed-phase columns are widely used for detection of pesticide residues.\nMass Spectrometry #  Mass Spectrometry\r\r\rGC-MS\n\rLC-MS\n\r\r\rsentence left\r\r\r\r\rsentence left\r\r sentence right.\r\r\r\r\rLC-MS:\nsingle quadrupole instruments are rarely used now for pesticide residue analysis, as, when combined with API sources, the technique lacks the selectivity required for both detection in complex matrices and for confirmation of identity. Single quadrupole MS has been superseded by MS/MS.\nLC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole instrument in MRM mode is currently the most widely used technique for the quantification of target pesticides as it delivers the sensitivity required for monitoring compliance with the legislation. The use of other modes, such as neutral loss or precursor ion scanning, is limited by poor sensitivity and specificity.\nChoose Mass Spectrometer #  MS/MS #  One of the current challenges for LC-MS/MS is to be able to acquire sufficient data points for quantification while acquiring an ever increasing number of MRM transitions, with very short dwell times (e.g., 5 ms), especially when coupled with UPLC.\nThe main limitation of triple quadrupoles in MRM mode is that confirmation of identity is based on the ratio of one or more MRM transition rather than full MS/MS product ion spectra. The replacement of Q3 in a QqQ instrument with a scanning LIT enhances its sensitivity in product ion scanning mode. Additionally, the system has MS3 capability and time-delayed fragmentation scans that aid structure elucidation. Quantitative (MRM) and qualitative (MS/MS or MS3 product ion spectra) work can be performed concomitantly on the same instrument. Although reports of the use of the QqLIT instrument for pesticide residue analysis are currently limited to material from the vendor it is in routine use in some laboratories.\nAs the lists of targeted compounds get longer, setting up time-segmented MRM methods becomes more and more complicated.\nMatrix effects are the major problem of LC-MS/MS [2].\nToF and Other Mass Spectrometer #  High resolution and accurate mass are available from four types of instruments: double-focusing magnetic sector, LIT-Orbitrap, FT-ICR, and TOF mass spectrometers.\nThe current trend in pesticide residue analysis is to use LC-TOF MS or LC-QTOF MS systems because they are easier and less expensive to operate compared with the other three mass spectrometers.\nAlthough TOF-MS can record accurate full spectral information with good sensitivity, this is of limited use unless resolution and mass accuracy are enhanced, as the spectra generated using the soft ionization API interfaces are usually characterized by a lack of fragment ions.\nLC-TOF instruments are capable of a resolving power of 10,000–20,000 (FWHM) and an accuracy of 2–5 ppm and the rapid acquisition rate combines well with fast chromatography systems.\nTOF was found to be around one order of magnitude less sensitive than a triple quadrupole instrument used in SRM mode and so sensitivity of LC-TOF may not always be sufficient for the intended application.\nAlthough acquisition rates have now improved (e.g., 20 spectra/s) and issues related to linear range still hamper the use of LC-TOF for quantification, some recent success has been reported.\n\rFigure : Schematic overview of a QTOF mass spectrometer\r\r\rThe development of the hybrid quadrupole–time-of-flight (QTOF) instruments presents the analyst with all the advantages indicated for the LC-TOF with the additional capability of accurate mass product ion scans. When confirming positive findings, both the exact masses and the relative intensities of all the product ions can be compared with those of the reference standard. The enhanced selectivity of MS=MS, when combined with high resolution and mass accuracy of the measurement of the product ions, provides low chemical background and hence improved quality of confirmation. The LC-QTOF has been used for the elucidation of pesticide metabolites and transformation products, but the potential is more limited when no previous knowledge is available. In such cases, the most common approach is to search a database for the molecular formula. The accurate product ion mass spectrum provides additional structural information, which can be used for comparative purposes with reference standards or to distinguish between isomers.\nAnalytical Techniques: #  LC–MS/MS was shown to be better suited for sulfonyl or benzoyl ureas, carbamates, and triazines than GC–MS. For the remainder pesticides, the application scope of LC–MS/MS was also wider than that of GC–MS. Both GC–MS and LC–MS based methods revealed a significant variation in sensitivity, covering at least a range of 3–4 orders of magnitude, depending on the pesticide analyzed. However, a comparison of the median of MDLs clearly showed much higher sensitivity if determinations were based on LC–MS/MS. The better performance of LC–MS/MS is probably determined by several reasons. Among them the larger injection volume used in LC–MS/MS (20 mL vs. 1 mL) and the lower amount of fragmentation during ionization (ESI vs. EI) may explain some of these differences.[3]\nGas Chromatography #  The choice of analytical technique used for the detection of pesticides is strongly dependent on the analyte’s polarity. Compounds with high log Kow, such as OCs, Py, and most OPs, are nonpolar and are preferably analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), while polar compounds such as carbamates, benzimidazoles, and some OPs are amenable by liquid chromatography (LC).\nLiquid Chromatography #  Although LC is the method of choice for thermally labile, ionic, and polar compounds, such as carbamates, urea, and phenoxy herbicides or benzimidazoles, it has been less applied than GC.\nMisc #  Currently, triple quadrupole (QqQ) is the first choice for pesticide residue analysis in routine laboratories using gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) systems (Go´mez-Ramos, Ferrer, Malato, Agu¨era, \u0026amp; Ferna´ndez-Alba, 2013).\nMost of screening methods used in routine laboratories detect the presence of pesticides as a pretarget screening (previously known compounds) by lowresolution mass spectrometry instruments, such as single quadrupole (Jedziniak, Szprengier-Juszkiewicz, \u0026amp; Olejnik, 2009), QqQ (Martı´nez-Vidal, Garrido-Frenich, Aguilera-Luiz, \u0026amp; Romero-Gonza´lez, 2010), and ion trap analyzers (Smith, Gieseker, Rimschuessel, Decker, \u0026amp; Carson, 2009), applying different scan modes.

So I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about electrospray ionization.\nElectrospray ionization, commonly referred to as ESI, is an example of an atmospheric pressure ionization (API) technique. Other examples include atmospheric pressure chemical ionization or APCI, and atmospheric pressure photo ionization or APPI.\nESI for LCMS, in its current form, was formally proposed by John Fenn and his coworker Masamichi Yamashita in the early 1980s. But process is very similar to ESI are observed and reported as far back as 1914, and even earlier.\nESI Structure #  In an ESI ion source, a narrow metal capillary is held at high voltage and a potential difference is produced between the capillary and the orifice at the mass spectrometer. A solution containing analyte ions, often an LC eluent, is sprayed from the capillary. Usually a flow of gas is also employed to more efficiently nebulize or break up the liquid stream into tiny droplets.\nWhat Does ESI Do? #  ESI requires the formation of ions in solution prior to the transfer of the gas phase. Typically, molecules are believed to undergo electrochemical reactions, either through redox reactions at the liquid metal interface of the capillary tip or through acid base reactions in solution.\nThe exact mechanism by which ions are transferred in the gas phase is still a matter for debate and ongoing research. But two main processes have been proposed.\n The Ion evaporation mechanism (IEM), where the electric field of the surface of highly charged small droplets become sufficient to yield desorbed ions directly from the surface. In this process, solvated ions leave the larger droplets sequentially, and the droplet shrinks until just desolvated ions remain.  2) For the charged residue module CRM where ions eventually become desolvated as solvent molecules leave the droplet surface. In this process, solvent molecules evaporate from the larger droplet and the droplet shrinks until just the desolvated ions remain. Evidence suggests that smaller ions are more likely to enter the gas phase by the IEM whereas larger multiple charged species are more likely to follow the CRM. Modifications or related processes to these two mechanisms have also been proposed.\nThe Difference between EI and ESI #  In contrast to vacuum ionization techniques, such as electron ionization or EI as it\u0026rsquo;s usually known, ESI is considered to be a soft ionization technique. This is because ESI typically produces intact ions related to the analyte molecule and fewer fragment ions than vacuum ionization techniques.\nIn EI to form positive ions high energy electrons in packed with the analyte molecules, knocking an electrode from the outer shell of the molecule and typically imparting enough energy to break up the molecular ion to produce fragment ions.\nIn ESI, to form positive ions, cations. For example, hydrogen ions often just called protons interact with the analyte molecules and form new bonds between the cations and the analyte molecules. This produces adduct ions also sometimes called cationized molecules, with a total mass equal to the mass of the analyte molecule plus the mass of the cation. It is also possible to form negative ions in ESI by forming adduct ions with anions, such as chloride ions, negative ions and ESI can also be formed by other processes such as proton abstraction, in which a proton is removed from an analyte molecule to leave a negatively charged ion. Close #  You can learn more about these processes in the video covering add information.

So I\u0026rsquo;m going to give a short presentation about adduct ions.\nAs we saw on the electrospray ionization video, the generation of ions in ESI usually involves the formation of adduct ions. Other the ionization techniques, such as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), atmospheric pressure photo ionization (APPI), and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization, commonly known as MALDI, can also produce adduct ions.\nWhat is Adduct Ion? #  \"Adduct ions are formed by the interaction of a precursor ion with one or more atoms or molecules to form an ion containing all of the constituent atoms of the precursor ion as well as the additional atoms from the Associated atoms or molecules\". Well, that's the formal definition of an adduct ion. But what does that actually mean? Here when we look at the adduct ion formation process in more detail. Typical Cations and Anions in Formation #  Typical cations that can form adduct ions in positive mode ESI include hydrogen ions, also known as protons that make singly charged adduct ions one mass unit heavier than the analyte molecules, sodium ions that make the singly charged adduct ions 23 mass units heavier than the analyte molecules, potassium ions that make singly charged at adduct ions 39 mass units heavier than the analyte molecules, and ammonium ions that make singly charged at adduct ion 18 mass units heavier than the analyte molecules. And typical anions that can form adduct ions in negative mode ESI include hydride ions that make singly charged at times were mass unit heavier than the analyte molecules. Chloride ions that make singly charged at times 35 or 37 mass units heavier than the analyte molecules depending on which isotope is forming the adult ion. bromide ions that make singly charged adduct ions 79 or 81 mass units heavier than the analyte molecules depending on which isotope is forming the adult ion. And acetate ions make singly charged adduct ions 59 mass units heavier than the analyte molecules. Enhancement of Formation #  To enhance the formation of adduct ions, compounds that readily form particular cations or anions can be added to sample solutions. This approach is particularly widely used in polymer analysis, when organic acids or salt solutions are added to polymer solutions to ensure that the analyte ionizes efficiently. Examples of compounds that can be used to enhance adduct ion formation in positive mode include formic acid, also known as methanoic acid, TFA, which stands for Trifluoroacetic acid, and acetic acid, also known as ethanoic acid. These examples all provide hydrogen ions to help enhance protonation.\nAlternatively, salt solutions containing specific cations can be used for positive ion mode. For example, Sodium Tetrafluoroacetate, or Silver Tetrafluoroacetate. Silver salts are particularly useful for some polymer analyses. For example, the silver cation bonds really easily with the styrene building blocks used to make polystyrene. Silver has two isotopes with nominal masses of 107 and 109, occurring in the ratio of approximately one to one. This means that adducts formed with silver ions have a characteristic isotope pattern in the mass spectrum.\nThis is a typical mass spectrum of polystyrene, we know this because the gap between each ion cluster in the spectrum is the same as the nominal mass of the styrene molecule that makes up polystyrene. If we take a closer look at one of the ion clusters, we can see that the ions are this unusual pattern which represents the isotope distribution of the ions formed. You can find out more about this in the video covering isotopes. Unfortunately, adduct ion formation is not as straightforward as we would like. Sometimes adduct ion formation could be out of our control. For example, older glassware is often a source of unwanted sodium ions. So even if we added a small amount of acid to remote protonation, we might also see some sodium adult ions formed as well.\nThis is a full scan mass spectrum of a sample containing a compound called Uvitex OB, which is an optical brightener polymer additive. This is added to polymers to make them appear and more bright white color. UVitex OB predominantly forms proton adult ions at mass charge 431. And we can see a nice intense peek at that mass charge. We can also see a small amount of sodium adduct ions at 453. When doing an analysis using ESI, we need to look out for the formation of different adduct ions. Deduction of the Site of Protonation #  Knowledge of some simple chemistry principles enables us to deduce the likely site of protonation in analyte molecules. Typically protonation occurs when an atom or atoms in the analyte molecule have at least one lone pair of electrons that are available to form a coordinate covalent bond with a proton. In other words, the cation is most likely to attach to the most basic site on the analyte molecule. Atoms that could be sites where cations might bond include nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.\nIf we take the case of the UVitex OB, we can see that there are several possible sites of protonation, two nitrogen atoms, two oxygen atoms and one sulfur atom. It is likely that the most basic atoms will be the site of protonation. So the proton will probably bond to one of the nitrogen atoms. The space around each atom can also play a part in cation attachment. So, here sulfur is unlikely to bond the proton as it does not have a lot of space around it. We describe it as being sterically hindered. Matrix Suppression #  The type of adduct ion formed can also be influenced by the other compounds present with the analyte in the sample mixture. These other compounds are background ions and are known as the matrix. Sometimes matrix components can compete with the analyte\u0026rsquo;s bond to the cations. If components in the background matrix are more basic than the analyte, then they will form adduct ions at the expense of the analyte of interest. This means that we do not see ions related to the analytes, and we say the analyte response has been suppressed. This is known as matrix suppression.\n"},{"id":84,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-01-Theory/Theory-Series-by-Waters/Theory_03_multiple_charging/","title":"3/7 Multiple Charging","section":"Theory Series by Waters","content":"Fundamentals of Mass Spectrometry provided by Waters (3 of 7)\nIn positive ion mode, cations will form bonds with lone pairs of electrons that are located on atoms in the analyte molecule. These atoms are typically nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur.\nwhen analyzing small molecules, only one cation bonds with a small molecule to make a single charged ion.\nWhen analyzing large molecules, there will be more atoms with lone pairs of electron, therefore more charges can be added to the molecule.\nOn the mass spectrum, we know that the x-axis represents the mass of the ion divided by the charge the ion is carrying. If the ion is single charged, the ion will be observed at M+1. If the ion gets two protons, the ion will be observed at M+2/2. If the charge is 4, the ion will be observed at M+4/4.\nThis is a transcript of the following video.\n\rHello, my name is Nick and I work at Waters Corporation as a principal analytical scientist. In this short video we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about multiple charging.\nWe learned about the process of ion formation in the Electrospray Ionization or ESI in the electrospray video. In this video, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at how ions can be formed with more than one charge. We\u0026rsquo;re going to look at multiple charged ions.\nH Ion with Small Molecules #  In positive ion mode, cations, for example, hydrogen ions, will form bonds with lone pairs of electrons that are located on atoms in the analyte molecule of interest. These atoms are typically nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. In the adduct ion video, we looked at the example of UVitex OB, an optical brightener polymer additive. Uvitex OB has a nominal mass of 430, contains two nitrogen atoms, two oxygen atoms and one sulfur atom. All five atoms could be the place where a cation could bond with a molecule. But in practice, other factors, such as relative basicity of each atom, and or any steric hindrances also come into play. In reality, only one cation, Usually a proton in the case of UVitex OB, bonds with a small molecule to make a single charged ion, probably on one of the nitrogen atoms.\nH Ion with Large Molecules #  The story gets more complicated when we start to analyze large molecules using ESI. Large molecules, for example, proteins or synthetic polymers can have many many places where cations could bond and add to charge the analyte. The larger the molecule, the more possible sites of cationization, and the more charges can be added to its structure, for the more charge an ion can carry.\nThe Effect on the Mass Spectrum #  Let\u0026rsquo;s consider what effect multiple charging will have on the mass spectrum. We know that the x-axis in a mass spectrum represents the mass of the ion divided by the charge the ion is carrying. This is very simple for single charged ions, because that means the mass is divided by one. Each mass spectral peak represents the mass of the ion. If the charge on the ion is greater than one, the m/z [m over z] value of the peak no longer represents the mass of the ion. The peak is shifted to a lower valley depending on the number of charges present.\nIn the case of a molecule that has a massive 1000, if it becomes an adduct ion getting one proton, then its mass will be 1001 and the charge will be one. So **the ion will be observed at m over z 1001**. If the same molecule becomes an adduct ion getting two protons, its overall mass will be 1002, but the charge will also be two. So the ion will be observed at 501 and so on. With three protons added, the mass is 1003 and the charge three, so the ion observed at 334.3. And with four protons added, the mass is 1004, the charge is 4, and the ion is m over z 251. If the same compound is observed to have different numbers of charges within the same spectrum, it is described as having different charge dates. This phenomenon of multiple charges can be very useful, because it enables us to analyze very high mass molecules, bringing them within the mass range of the mass spectrometer.\nC-13 Isotope #  The presence of carbon 13 isotopes and other atoms with isotopes in a molecule means that each analyte compound does not produce a single individual ion, but a cluster of ions depending on the distribution of isotopes present. You can learn more about this in the video about isotopes. Information about the number of charges on an ion can also be derived by examining the isotope clusters for that ion. However, we have to be careful because reasonably high mass resolution is usually required to be able to accurately distinguish the lower intensity isotopes. And often quadrupole mass spectrometers do not deliver sufficient mass resolution for the user to see the isotope pattern clearly.\nThe gap between the individual ions within an isotope cluster tells us the charge state of an ion. We'll look at some isotope model classes to see how. Here a single charge isotope cluster has a gap of one unit between adjacent ions. The isotope cluster for the same molecule with a double charge has a gap of half a unit between the adjacent ions. And for an isotope cluster with triple charge, the gap is 0.33. Mathematically the gap between the adjacent ions in an isolated cluster is given by one divided by the charge of the ion. So using this logic, we can deduce that a quadruple charged ion and have a gap of 0.25 units between the adjacent ions of the cluster. In this example, the data was acquired at a high resolution mass spectrometer. Here we can see the extremely complex spectrum of a polymer sample called polyethylene Glycol, or PEG. The structure of PEG has lots of sites where protons and other cations can join the molecule because there are many oxygen atoms regularly spaced around the polymer chain. PEG readily forms ions with multiple charges. If we take a closer look at some of the ion clusters within the spectrum, we can start to learn more about the different charge states present. Here the ions are one unit apart, so, they must have a single charge, whereas here the gap is half a unit, so they must have a double charge. In fact, in this particular spectrum, we can distinguish charge states from one plus all the way up to seven plus. The gap between the ions in this cluster is approximately 0.14, which is one divided by seven. In the case of mass spectrometry of large biomolecules, it is possible for even higher numbers of charge states, for example, proteins with masses around 150,000 Daltons and have charges in excess of 20."},{"id":85,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-01-Theory/Theory-Series-by-Waters/Theory_04_Quadrupoles/","title":"4/7 Quadrupoles","section":"Theory Series by Waters","content":"Fundamentals of Mass Spectrometry provided by Waters (4 of 7)\nA quadruploe consists of four parallel rods arranged around the central axis.\nStatic potentials or DC voltages, and alternating potentials or RF voltages are applied to the quadrupole rods with one pair of rods having the opposite polarity to the other pair. These voltages create a fluctuating electric field between the rods.\nDifferent ions can pass through the quadrupole and won\u0026rsquo;t strike rods under different ratios of the RF and DC voltages. As the the DC to RF ratio is increased linearly with time, the ions of that particular mass are transmitted through the quadrupole to the detector.\nThis is a transcript of the following video.\n\rHello, my name is Dave, I work at Waters corporation as a development scientist, I\u0026rsquo;m going to give a brief overview of what a quadrupole is and how it works.\nStructure #  So a quadrupole is a mass analyzer, and it consists of four parallel rods arranged around the central axis as shown. Static potentials or DC voltages, and alternating potentials or RF voltages are applied to the quadrupole rods with one pair of rods having the opposite polarity to the other pair. These voltages create a fluctuating electric field between the rods. The field oscillates as shown, typically at frequencies of approximately one megahertz. The stability of an ion when passing through this field is dependent on the mass to charge ratio of the ion. Since the voltage is defined the field and we control the voltages that can be set such that only a single mass to charge ratio is stable and can pass down the length of the quadrupole. Ions whose mass to charge ratio is too large or too small, have unstable motion. They strike the quadrupole rods and therefore aren't detected. The ion motion within a quadrupole is relatively complex, so we won't go into details here. It's possible to plot ratios of the RF and DC voltages for which the ion motion does not extend beyond the inscribed radius of the rods in the X and the Y axis. In other words, we can derive ratios where the ion motion is stable. So plotting this gives the following. Obviously, for an ion to make it through the quadrupole it needs to be stable in both the x and y axis. And from this plot, we can see that there are several regions where the stability zones overlap. But all commercial quadruples use what's called the first stability region, mainly because this is where the voltage requirements are the lowest. If we look closer at this region, we can see it has the following shape. The stability region is dependent on the mass to charge ratio of the ion. So if we plot the stability regions of different masses on a single axis, we get the following. Typically, when scanning with a quadrupole, the RF and DC are ramped linearly with time. As the voltages are increased, the scan line cuts through the stability regions of different masses, and the ions of that particular mass are transmitted through the quadrupole to the detector. A plot can then be created as signal versus time, which is translated into a plot of signal versus mass, or in other words, a mass spectrum. We're able to resolve the masses from each other because the scan line doesn't cross two stable regions at the same time. We can also increase the DC to RF ratio to the point where the scan line crosses the very tips of disability regions. As you can see, as we do that, the peak widths are reduced. Therefore the resolution is increased. As we attempt to operate a quadrupole at higher and higher resolution, the transmission reduces because the entry conditions become more and more stringent. In other words, the ions must enter closer and closer to the central axis to make it through. The theoretical limit of the resolution of the quadrupole relates to the number of cycles of RF the ion is exposed to. So increasing the frequency of the RF, making the quadrupole longer or slowing the ions down will increase the theoretical maximum. However, there are practical limitations to the resolution performance of quadruples, which are dominated by the mechanical accuracy of the quadrupole itself.\nBecause of this, quadruples are generally operated with a resolution set to what is known as unit resolution, this is the point at which ions with a mass difference of one amu can be resolved from each other.

I\u0026rsquo;m going to give a brief description of what is meant by the term resolution when it comes to mass spectrometry.\nPerhaps the most common usage of the term resolution relates to optical devices such as cameras or television screens. In that case, the resolution is often defined by the number of pixels the screen is made up of, which essentially is the definition of how detailed picture can be captured or displayed.\nUnit Resolution #  The premise is similar in mass spectrometry. Here the resolution is a measure of the ability to separate ions of one mass from those of another. So essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s a measure of how detailed a spectrum the mass spec can generate. For low resolution mass spectrometers such as quadrupole instruments, the resolution is generally defined as the full width of the peak at half its maximum height, commonly abbreviated to FWHM. This value is set to approximately 0.7 amu and is not dependent on the mass being measured. So it sets this value for the whole mass range of the instrument. Using this resolution, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to resolve one mass from the next integer mass. So for example, it\u0026rsquo;d be possible to distinguish mass 50 from mass 51 or mass 1000 from mass 1001. This is known as unit resolution.\nHigh Resolution Definition #  For high resolution mass spectrometry, a different measure is typically used. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry defined the resolution of a mass spec in two ways, depending if overlapping peaks are present or not.\n1) If just a single peak is present, with no overlapping peaks, a singlet method is used. In this case, the resolution is expressed as the mass of the peak divided by the peak width at either 5 or 50% of the peak height. 2) If more than one peak is present, and the peaks overlap, this makes the measurement of the peak width at 5% difficult. So in this case, a doublet method can be applied. Here, the resolution is measured using two overlapping peaks of approximately equal height, where the value between the peaks is at a given value, typically 10%. In this case, the resolving power is calculated as the mass of the second peak divided by the difference in mass between the peaks. Essentially, both of these calculations are a measure of the instruments ability to resolve ions of one mass from ions of an adjacent mass. But the singlet and doublet methods will result in different values for resolving power. So it's important to know which method was used. Application of Increased Resolution #  Instruments with higher and higher resolution capabilities are being developed all the time. But what does increased resolution gives us? Well, as well as being better able to distinguish ions of different mass from each other. High resolution leads to higher absolute mass accuracy. This can be extremely beneficial.\nFor example, on a low resolution instrument 2-octanone and naphthalene would essentially appear to be identical because the mass difference is less than 60 mili-daltons. However, as the resolution is increased, the peaks can be resolved from each other, and the accurate mass of each peak can be measured. That precision allows the potential molecular formula to be narrowed down to only a few possibilities. Not only does this improve the confidence to peak detected is the compound of interest, it also reduces the risk of contaminants interfering with the results. High resolution also allows analysis a very large complex compounds such as proteins, peptides, and oligosaccharides, because their tendency to form multiple charged ions, particularly through electrospray ionization. The ability to accurately identify the mass uncharged state of the detected peaks allows calculation of the actual mass of the compound. The combination of high resolution and high mass accuracy is a powerful tool in compound identification, structural elucidation, and research and discovery applications."},{"id":87,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-01-Theory/Theory-Series-by-Waters/Theory_06_Isotopes/","title":"6/7 Isotopes","section":"Theory Series by Waters","content":"Fundamentals of Mass Spectrometry provided by Waters (6 of 7)\nThis is a transcript of the following video.\n\rHello, my name is Nick and I work at waters Corporation as a principal analytical scientist. In this short video, we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about isotopes.\nIsotope Definition #  Isotopes are atoms of an element with normal numbers of protons and electrons, but different numbers of neutrons. Isotopes of the same atomic number, but different mass numbers. The different isotopes of an element have identical chemical properties. The abundance of isotopes is different but known for each element. For example, 98.93% of carbon atoms on Earth, the molecular weight of 12, called carbon 12, and 1.07% have an extra neutron and a molecular weight of 13 or carbon 13. Other elements different relative abundance a number of isotopes. chlorine, for example, has two stable isotopes. 75% of chlorine atoms are chlorine 35, 25% are chlorine 37. Whereas 99.636% of nitrogen atoms and nitrogen 14 and only 0.364% nitrogen 15. And for all intents and purposes, you can assume hydrogen contains only one isotope.\nIsotopes Pattern in Mass Spec #  In mass spectrometry, we need to be able to accurately measure the relative amounts of these isotopes, and also be able to predict the ratios based on an elemental formula. The pattern of the different isotopes from a multi-atom species are generally referred to as an isotope pattern. The first peak containing only the lowest mass isotope is referred to as a mono isotope. The next is the first isotope, second isotope, etc. Prediction of an isotope pattern from a given elemental composition at first sight seems straightforward. For example, take a molecule of decane consisting of 10 carbons and 23 hydrogens. We know the percentage of heavy isotope of carbon carbon 13 is 1.07% and zero isotopes of hydrogen. If we have one carbon, the relative height the first isotope would be 1.07%. For two carbon, it will be 2.14%, etc. So the relative height of the first isotope for molecule with 10 carbons will be 10 times 1.07%, or 10.7%. When you start to consider prediction of the further isotopes, it gets complicated quickly, and even for single element species with only two isotopes like hydrocarbons. When you consider a relatively simple organic molecule such as caffeine, the prediction of the isotope pattern involves long multinomial calculations. Unless you're a glutton for complex math problems, many software based solutions are freely available, and the first choice for most mass spectrometrists. If you were to consider the carbon isotopes in the prediction of the isotope pattern for caffeine, first, second, and third isotopes will be 8.6%, 0.32%, and 0.007%, respectively. However, an accurate calculation using isotopes of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen predicts them to be at 10.34%, 0.89%, and 0.05%. This highlights the way we can use the isotope patterns in mass spectrometry. With all mass spectrometry we are either trying to identify a species or confirm what we think it is. By using the information encoded in the isotope pattern, we can make assumptions about the number and the types of atoms that are present. In a simplified example, if the first isotope is 16%, then we can reasonably assume 12 to 15 carbons are present. If the first isotope is significantly lower or higher than this, the assumption cannot be true. Heteroatoms like chlorine and bromine give rise to very distinct patterns that can further aid in interpretation. For example, here, some theoretical isotope patterns for chlorine and bromine containing compounds, compared to a carbon only. Given the complexity of organic systems and a number of combination of elements, 1000s of compounds can have the same mass. For any compound the elemental composition can be used to generate a theoretical isotope pattern, which can be compared to an acquired spectrum. This can, for example, enable us to distinguish between two compounds at the same mass but different elements or compositions. The predicted isotope pattern for chloramphenicol, chlorine containing antibiotic, is very different to that of a compound with the same `m over z` found in the background sample like urine. Here we can see the predicted isotope pattern of chloramphenicol compared to a spectrum recorded from a compound with exactly the same amount monoisotopic `m over z`. We can use this information to ensure we're measuring the drug during an assay rather than a background endogenous species. This is an extreme case to illustrate the point, but software can be used to differentiate much subtler differences."},{"id":88,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-01-Theory/Theory-Series-by-Waters/Theory_07_Fragmentation/","title":"7/7 Fragmentation","section":"Theory Series by Waters","content":"Fundamentals of Mass Spectrometry provided by Waters (7 of 7)\nFragmentation occurs at CID. The CID yields fragments using relatively low energies. The drawback of the CID is its difficulty to predict the results for complex molecules.\nThis is a transcript of the following video.\n\rHello, my name is Nick and I work at waters Corporation as a principal analytical scientist. And in this short video, we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about fragmentation.\nHow CID works? #  As well as measuring the m over z of whole molecules, certain mass spectrometers can be used in such a way as to break apart or fragment molecules and measure the m/z of these fragments. This information can be used to try and understand or elucidate the connectivity within the molecule. Or it can be used to increase the specificity of analysis by measuring the precursor and fragment masses. To do this, we must understand how molecules break apart in a mass spectrometer. Most mass specs use collision-induced association or CID, which yields fragments using relatively low energies. CID is common in mass spec because it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to implement, easy to use, but it can be difficult to predict the results for complex molecules. In very basic terms, the CID will accelerate molecules into an inert gas often argon or nitrogen, the molecules hit the gas and energy is transferred, causing the bonds to break. It\u0026rsquo;s not unlike breaking a Lego model by throwing marbles at it.\nA Bond Energy Table #  In this example, the verapamil molecule with m/z of 455, had been fragmented in the mass spec and the fragmentation spectrum required is shown. You can see some precursor remaining and also a number of ions at lower m/z and various intensities. Begin to make sense of this fragmentation spectrum, we need to look at the structure of the verapamil molecule. As you can see, the molecule is very simplistically, two aromatic rings joined together by a chain containing carbon and nitrogen atoms. The most obvious sites that you would expect this molecule to break along this connecting chain. However, not all bonds are equal, we can estimate the strength of each bond in this molecule, and therefore how easy or likely it is for it to break by looking at a bond energy table like this. By comparing the energies of the various bonds, we can suggest that the bond most likely to break is the nitrogen carbon bond here, followed by the carbon carbon bond and then the carbon oxygen bond. The energy required to break aromatic ring is normally too high for CID. If you apply this idea in the future, remember this simplistic model only the actual bond energies are affected by other adjacent groups of atoms. So don't be surprised at the results you obtained from real molecule definitely your prediction. By using this idea, we can predict that we might see fragment ions at 165, 300, 194 and 289. Fragmentation spectrum actually looks like this. And we can see that we did predict both Fragment A and B as shown. But we see no evidence of the others in this spectrum. As I mentioned before, many other factors come into play when fragmenting molecules, including but not limited to the location of bonds within the whole molecule and the specific location of the adduct. The relative intensity of fragments is linked to the likelihood of a bond or bonds in breaking and in turn is linked to bond energy. Bond energies for carbon nitrogen bond is in the order of 293 kilojoules per mole. And for a carbon carbon bond around 347 kilojoules per mole. If you look at the fragmentation spectrum, you can see that Fragment B is four to five times less intense than Fragment A. And this is because more energy required to break that carbon carbon bond and so it just happens less often. Fragmentation of Peptides #  All molecules will behave differently, but basic chemistry rules governing bond energies will always remain the same. So it is possible to predict what the fragmentation spectrum may look like. For example, peptides or linear chains of amino acids linked by amide bonds. Under CID, most of these amide bonds will fragment equally.\nSo typically you get a ladder like fragmentation spectra like this. By using simple rules and chemistry knowledge, we can use fragmentation spectra to help us identify unknown compounds or increased confidence in the identification when screening. A basic understanding of the rules is important but like many things in mass spectrometry, many software packages help with data interpretation."},{"id":89,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-01-Theory/LCMSMS_Analyte_Tuning_Waters/","title":"Analyte Tuning","section":"Part I Theory","content":"LC-MS/MS Education Series 3/3 by Waters\n\rHi, I\u0026rsquo;m Scott Freeto and I\u0026rsquo;m a mass spec application specialist here at Waters corporation. In today\u0026rsquo;s video on analyte tuning, I\u0026rsquo;m going to walk through the procedure for tuning a Waters standard quadrupole mass spectrometer.\nTuning is a procedure that optimizes or re-optimizes the detection of specific compounds using the mass spec. It may be done at the time of initial method development, or if the performance of the instrument has diminished a bit.\nPlease be sure to view quadrupole theory and use and quadrupole resolution and mass calibration prior to watching this video. Quadrupole theory and use covers the basic principles of a quadrupole and the various modes of using a tandem quadrupole instrument. This background information will be helpful in understanding why when tuning manually, we will progress through the various MS and MSMS modes of operation.\nIn our quadrupole resolution and mass calibration video, I discussed the importance of having a good mass calibration and resolution setup on the mass spectrometer before tuning, so that the instrument has a good reference point on which we can tune. It is also worth noting that if you prefer to tune using IntelliStart, which I\u0026rsquo;ll also cover in this video, a valid calibration and resolution are required.\nBecause when we tune, we will be infusing our analyte of interest combined with mobile phase. Make sure that your assays mobile phases are on the liquid chromatograph and they have been primed. Also ensure that there is a column in the column manager so that when mobile phase is flowing, there won\u0026rsquo;t be a leak in your column manager.\nBefore we get started, make sure that the instrument is in operate, indicated by the green button and operated appearing on the tune page. Also make sure that the atmospheric pressure ionization (API) gas is turned on as indicated by the depressed API button, also on the tune page.\nFirst, we will tune a set of compounds using IntelliStart, and then repeat it with the same compounds manually.\nPrepare a mixture of compounds to be tuned. Typically, you\u0026rsquo;ll need between one and two milliliters of tuning solution with each compound between 101,000 nanograms per mil. This concentration depends upon the sensitivity of the instrument you are using, and how well the compound ionizes. While there is no limit to the number of compounds that can be mixed together in a single tuning solution, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest not mixing compounds that are within five Dalton\u0026rsquo;s of each other. Please know the more compounds mixed together, the more complex the resulting spectra will be. I would suggest starting with a compound that is likely to be the most analytically challenging. This might be because the compound in your samples will be at a low concentration or maybe it is known to ionize poorly. Once you identify the compound that is the most challenging, you can set all the tune page parameters to optimize this compound, including parameters such as temperatures and gas flows that cannot be optimized for individual compounds.\nOnce the tuning mix has been made, attach it to one of the reservoirs on the front of the mass spec. Select the appropriate reservoir to coincide with where the tune mix is located. If you had to change the reservoir designation, the fluidics will purge automatically. If you did not have to change the reservoir designation, press the purge button. You will know that the purge is complete when the status returns to idle. Ensure that the mobile phase is flowing at a flow rate and composition similar to what it will be when the analyte elute from the column. It is not necessary to change the percentage of mobile phases for each compound. Simply estimate an average composition representative of an analyte that elutes in the middle of the chromatogram. Once the tuning mix is purged and the mobile phase flow is established, set the valve position to combined so that the tuning solution and mobile phase will be combined together.\nSet the flow rate of the tuning solution to 10 microliters per minute and press the start and fusion button. Double check to make sure that you see a spray coming from the tip of the capillary just above the cone orifice. The mixture I\u0026rsquo;m using today contains four compounds. They are Caffeine and N-Desmethyl Trimipramine, Alprazolam and D-5 Alprazolam.\nThis table shows the name, formula average molecular weight, and monoisotopic molecular weight for each compound. The average molecular weight is the average molecular weight taking into account all the isotopes of the elements that it contains. The monoisotopic molecular weight is the molecular weight of a molecule of this compound with just the most abundant isotope of each element. You'll notice that for compounds, like Caffeine and N-Desmethyl Trimipramine, the monoisotopic molecular weight is only slightly less than the average molecular weight, because the only element with isotopes is carbon, which is mostly carbon 12, and only a small amount of carbon 13. Alprazolam however, contains one chlorine atom, 76% of naturally occurring chlorine has a mass of 35 and 24% has a mass of 37. When you look up the mass of Alprazolam it will usually be given as 308.8. But the mass of the most abundant isotope will be 308.1. This difference of 0.7 Dalton's may be confusing if you're not expecting it. `N-Desmethyl Trimipramine` is another interesting example. As it is usually purchased from chemical supply companies as a salt. In this case, it was purchased as a maleate salt with a formula of C23H28N204 and a total average molecular weight of 396.5. Because when the salt is dissolved it dissociates forming the Free base with a formula of C19H24N2 with an average molecular weight of 280.4. It is this free base form that we are interested in when doing mass spectrometry. When purchasing other compounds, you will likely purchase hydrochloride or hydrobromide salts as well. These salts are treated the same way when calculating the molecular weight of the compound you expect to analyze. Fortunately, the chemical suppliers almost always packaged the standards, so that the concentration on the bottle is for the free base form. I have selected these compounds due to their varying structures and weights. For demonstration purposes only. You should select the compounds that are applicable to the clinical assay you are planning to perform.\nBecause deuterated or carbon 13 labeled internal standards are considerably more expensive than their unlabeled counterparts. We really only need to tune the labeled internal standard once. This is because we know the mass of the label standard will be 1 Dalton and heavier than the unlabeled version for each deuterium or carbon 13 Atom incorporated in the molecule. We also know that the cone voltage will be the same for both the labeled and unlabeled version.\nFinally, we know that the collision energies used to generate the most abundant fragments in the unlabeled analyte will also produce the most abundant fragments in the labeled compound. What we don\u0026rsquo;t know at the outset is what the mass of those fragments of the labeled compound will be. Sometimes they will be the same as those of the unlabeled, sometimes they will be heavier. Either way, once we know the fragment that is generated, we know that new lots of the same material from the same vendor will yield the same fragments.\nIntelliStart can tune up to four compounds at a time and will generate a report and write the results to the MS method used for data acquisition.\nTo initiate IntelliStart, select IntelliStart from the mass spec portion of the acuity console. The system tune and develop method checkbox should be checked and then press start.\nIn the setup parameters dialog box, we can first define the compound details in the top portion of the dialog box. Here we enter the name of the compounds and give IntelliStart an idea what the mass of the analyte is going to be.\nWe can define this in one of two ways as shown. We can enter the mass of the neutral analyte or enter the molecular formula. Next we define if IntelliStart will be generating a new tune page with newly optimized parameters, or if it should simply use an existing tune page.\nNext we define the type of MS method that is to be generated, which is almost always an MRM method. When using a tandem quadrupole instrument. There is a checkbox that can be selected to cause the results of this tuning set to be appended to an existing MS method. This is helpful if you are generating an MS method with many compounds as you can only tune them for at a time. The bottom section of the window allows you to define the range of cone voltages and collision energies that will be scanned. The number of MRM transitions you want to generate for each compound, as well as whether or not the tune solution will be combined with mobile phase during tuning. Once all the options have been defined on this page, simply clicking the Start button will commence the tuning process.\nAt the completion of IntelliStart tuning, if all compounds were detected and the desired number of fragments was found, then a green tick mark will be displayed.\nAs we tune manually, we will be using tune tabs on the tune page ESI positive and fluidics will use the fluidics tab to purge the fluidics of the mass spec with our tuning solution. Start and stop the infusion of our analytes as well as define the amount and location of sample to be infused. If requested, a tuning report will be displayed or saved and the MS method will be written or appended as requested. The ESI tab will be used to modify voltages, temperatures and gas flows that optimize the ionization and transmission of our analytes.\nNow that the tuning solution has been flowing for a few moments, when displaying the appropriate masses on the tune page, you should see signal for the four compounds. Here you can see that I have four tune page windows open. Each window is displaying a full scan spectrum using the first quadrupole. The set mass for each window is for the protonated M+H monoisotopic mass for each compound. The width of each window is set to 4 Dalton, and the gain of each window is set to show each signal between half and full scale. Because full scan data acquisition is an MS experiment, the button for MS experiments is depressed and the collision gas is off.\nIf we now switch to the ESI tab, we can see all the user definable voltages, gas flows and temperatures on the instrument. The resolution and ion energy settings should be left at the same values that were set during the resolution setup and mass scale calibration. Otherwise, the other settings on this page can be modified as necessary to give rise to the most intense signal for the most analytically challenging compound.\nOnce those values are set for that compound, the cone voltage only will be optimized for each subsequent compound. While tuning in MS mode, make note of the mass of the most abundant isotope, and the optimal cone voltage for each compound. You can see that the chlorine containing spectra are a bit different than those that do not contain chlorine. I\u0026rsquo;ve now closed all the windows, except that for the N-Desmethyl Trimipramine to make the view less confusing. One of the greatest advantages of doing analysis using tandem mass spectrometry is that the technique allows us to measure many compounds at the same time. As we measure many compounds, there are certain parameters that we can change very quickly, and thus be optimized for every analyte. These include the M over Z of the precursor in product ions, the cone voltage that optimizes the entry of the compound into the cone of the mass spec source and the collision energies that optimize the generation of the specific fragments we intend to measure. This leaves many other settings such as temperatures, gas flows, and some voltages that will remain constant during the analysis of all the analytes. Because these other settings may affect the generation and transmission of the analytes. It might be advantageous to optimize these settings for the most analytically challenging compound in the analysis.\nThis might be the analyte that is expected to be the lowest concentration or the analyte. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t ionize or fragment particularly well. For this reason I would start tuning with this analyte or if running IntelliStart, I\u0026rsquo;d run this compound by itself at the outset to develop the tune page settings. After optimizing and recording the cone voltage and precursor mass for each analyte in the mix. Switch the instrument to MSMS mode by turning on the collision gas and depressing the MSMS function button. Looking at one compound at a time, we\u0026rsquo;ll set the cone voltage to the value that optimize the ionization for that compound. Set the function for the scope to be a daughter ion scan, and then set the mass as the mass of the precursor determined in MS mode. With the mask value set a little higher than half the set value and the span value set to the same as the set value you will see a spectrum usually with just a single ion at the mass of the precursor. As you increase the collision energy, fragment ions will start to appear. You can then zoom in on each of the fragment ions record their mass and optimize and record the collision energy at which the signal is optimize. It is very common to optimize the generation for at least two fragments for each analyte as these multiple fragments will be the basis for monitoring ion ratios as another indicator of peak identification. After all the compounds are tuned in this fashion, the values that were recorded along the way can be entered into an MS method saved and used for data acquisition.\nI hope you found this information on analyte tuning to be helpful and informative to review analyte tuning identifies precursor and product masses and sets mass spec parameters to optimize the sensitivity and specificity for that analyte in your resulting assay. Tuning is performed during method development or can be used periodically to re optimize an assay. Tuning can be performed manually or automatically using the IntelliStart routine included in mass links. Having a recent resolution setup and mass calibration are important to have in place before tuning. And lastly, an understanding of how quadruples work, and their modes of operation makes the tuning steps more logical.\nI hope you found this video useful.

I\u0026rsquo;m going to walk through the procedure for setting the quad resolution and mass scale calibration of your Waters tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer.\nHaving valid resolution and mass calibration prior to tuning compounds is important. Because recalibrating may be an effective first step in reestablishing the sensitivity performance of an instrument.\nFortunately, using IntelliStart embedded in your MassLynx software, this is a relatively simple task to perform. These calibrations are performed by your water service engineer after they perform routine preventive maintenance and are generally good for about six months. Still, it can be helpful to perform these calibrations as a simple step towards improving system performance.\nIf you click on calibration on the tune page, a window will open with information about the most recent calibration. This information includes when the last calibration was performed, the mass range, the scan speeds, resolution settings and ion energies for each quadrupole.\nEach Xevo tandem quadrupole model has a specific calibration solution that is typically used for that instrument, you can order the appropriate calibrate solution for your instrument using the part number shown.\nDilute the calibration solution as directed in the package insert.\nFrom the sample list page, open the MS console, the MS console will take several seconds to open.\nOnce the MS console opens, click on IntelliStart under the name of your mass spectrometer model.\nThen click on the Show Instrument Setup Options button.\nSelect both the instrument resolution and instrument calibration checkboxes and then select Start.\nThis IntelliStart Screen will tell you the default parameters that will be used when calibrating the instrument provided you with some options for saving and printing the resolution and calibration reports.\nThe screen will also tell you which positions on the front of the instrument the calibration solution should be placed.\nWe are using a Xevo TQ-S micro as an example. So the same solution is used for the resolution and calibration and therefore reservoir a shown for both.\nSince we now know the default reservoirs for the recalibration solution, we can put it in the appropriate reservoir.\nOnce the calibration solution has been attached to the instrument, purged the fluidics for the appropriate reservoir. Once the fluidics indicates that the Purge is complete, by displaying the status as idle, set the valve position to infusion and begin the infusion of calibration solution at 10 microliters per minute by clicking on the start button.\nAt the conclusion of the resolution and calibration process, there will be green tick marks to indicate successful calibrations. should either of the procedures fail, this would be indicated with a red X.\nA resolution report can then be reviewed and the calibration window will be updated with the new calibration information.\nThe resolution settings and ion energies for each quadrupole set by the new calibration should be used going forward when optimizing or tuning compounds for analysis.\nTo review, prior to tuning analytes quadrupole resolution and mass calibration are beneficial first steps and resolution setup and mass calibration are easily performed using automated and tele start routines within MassLynx.\nI hope you found this video useful.

A quadrupole assembly consists of four parallel rods equally spaced around the central axis. Single quadrupole mass spectrometers have one assembly while tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers have two assemblies separated by a collision cell. During the early days of quadrupole mass spectrometry, the collision cell was a quadrupole as well, resulting in three quadrupole assemblies in the mass spectrometer. That is why many scientists may refer to tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers as triple quadruples.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at how a quadrupole works. Within the quadrupole assembly, a fluctuating field is created by applying RF and DC voltages to the quadrupole rods. Opposite rods have the same voltage is applied. This field affects the trajectory of ions traveling down the flight path between the rods based upon their mass to charge ratio. Each mass to charge ratio has an optimum RF DC setting, which creates a stable trajectory through the quadrupole. Thus, the quadrupole can be programmed so that only a specific mass to charge ratio is stable down the length of the quadrupole. Ions whose mass to charge is either too large or too small have an unstable flight path and ultimately strike the rods and are lost. Typically, a quadrupole can be operated in one of two ways, static or scanning. All acquisition modes are based on these two modes of operation.\nIn static mode, the RF and DC setting is set to only transmit the ion of interest and all other ions are lost. Thus, operating in static mode provides the highest sensitivity for the ion of interest, because the quadrupole spends the entire dwell time transmitting only the specified mass to charge ratio. Since only the selected mass to charge ratio is recorded, it is the only one observed in the mass spectrum rather than the multiple signals across the entire mass range as seen in a typical mass spectrum. This is the most common mode used in quantitative analysis. Since it is the most sensitive and additional information is not needed. On a single quad, this is called SR or selected ion recording. This mode may also be called SRM or selected ion monitoring. In scanning mode, the RF and DC settings are ramped over time to create the typical mass spectrum. Ions are only transmitted to the detector when the RF and DC setting is correct to allow stable motion for that particular mass to charge ratio. The scan time is the amount of time the quadrupole spends scanning the entire mass range from the start mass to the end mass. Thus, if the mass spectrometer scans at 10,000 Dalton's per second and the mass ranges from 200 to 1200 Daltons or a difference of 1000 Daltons, the scan time is point one seconds, this is called Full Scan mode. This mode provides the most information about all the ions in your sample. However, it is not as sensitive as selected ion monitoring, because the quadrupole transmits each mass to charge ratio for only a small percentage of the total scan time. Sometimes, when working with a tandem quadrupole instrument, we talk about doing MS or MSMS acquisitions. An MS acquisition is when we set just one of the quadruples to either static or scanning mode while the other quadrupole is set with an RF voltage only and no DC voltage. When in this mode, the quadrupole will allow all ions to pass through without affecting them. The other characteristic of an MS experiment is that the collision cell is set to also pass all ions through without fragmentation. An MSMS experiment is one where each quadrupole is set to either static or scanning mode. And if adequate collision energy is imparted to the collision cell, fragmentation will occur. \rThe quads in an MSMS acquisition can be set as scanning or static, allowing us to acquire data in several different modes.\r\r /* image and text side-by-side */\r* {\rbox-sizing: border-box;\r}\r.row {\rmargin-left:-5px;\rmargin-right:-5px;\r}\r.column {\rfloat: left;\rpadding: 5px; /* space between two tables*/\r}\r/* Clearfix (clear floats) */\r.row::after {\rcontent: \"\";\rclear: both;\rdisplay: table;\r}\r/* end of the setting for two tables side-by-side */\r\rThe most common acquisition mode using a tandem quad however is known as MRM. Multiple reaction monitoring where both quads are set to static mode. This is the most common way to use a tandem quad because it is the most sensitive mode for quantitative analysis. The first quadrupole will pass only the precursor or intact form of the analyte while the second quadrupole is set to pass a specific fragment of the analyte that was generated in the collision. So, I hope you found this information on quadrupole theory and use to be helpful and informative. To review, quadrupole assemblies are a set of four parallel rods that work together to control the trajectory of ions in the mass spectrometer. A fluctuating field is generated inside the quadrupole by applying RF and DC voltages to the quadrupole rods. The path of the ion through the field is based upon its mass to charge ratio. Quadruples can be static with the RF and DC settings are optimized to transmit only the mass to charge ratio of interest allowing only those ions through the mass spectrometer. And lastly, they can also scan where the RF and DC voltage settings are ramped to let ions through the quadrupole in order of increasing mass to charge ratio. A wide range of acquisition modes such as full scan, MRM precursor ion scan, product, ions scan, and neutral loss scan are available on tandem quad mass spectrometers.\nI hope you found this video useful.

It represents the cation molecule. Its m/z is associated with the molar mass of compound.\nThe base peak represents the most stable cation fragment. It is a stable intermediate, not a stable structure. Its intensity is set as 100, everything else is in comparison to it. It could represent the M+.\nTranscript:\nWhat is the difference between the parent M+ (M plus) peak and the base peak?\n Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a mass spec. And you can see this is for benzyl chloride. And the parent peak, or what\u0026rsquo;s known as the M+ (M plus) peak is this one right here at 126. And then the bass peak is here at 91.\nThe M plus peak known as the parent peak, is going to be the peak associated with the molar mass of the compound. The way that mass spectroscopy works is that it takes your compound, it puts it into an area where it\u0026rsquo;s going to be bombarded with high level energy, and you end up removing electrons from the compound and forming radicals, now when you form these radicals, you can also form cations. It is the cations that end up getting detected. So when we talk about m/Z (mass to charge) ratio, when you form a cation, usually you have +1. And so anything divided by one is itself. So this means that m/z (m over z) is just represented by m, which is the mass here. So when we get ready to look at an organic compound, we have removed two electrons somewhere from the structure, and we have created the cation. sometimes it can really be associated anywhere with this compound. But that is the M+ (M plus). And that\u0026rsquo;s going to be the structure itself, because electrons are negligible when they contribute to mass. So that is the molar mass.\nNow what is the base peak? the base peak, which is the tallest peak that you\u0026rsquo;re going to see. is sometimes it could be the M+ (M plus) peak, but usually it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be usually the base peak is going to be the result of the most stable cat ion that can be formed. So in the case of benzyl chloride, when we get a benzylic cation, so the removal of chlorine and you have the CH2 with the plus, this is incredibly stable because you have resonance positioning all over the ring here, so there\u0026rsquo;s three other locations besides the CH2, that this plus charge can be delocalized over. And that makes it a very stable, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to say it\u0026rsquo;s a stable structure, but it\u0026rsquo;s a stable intermediate when compared to a lot of the other intermediate cations. And because of that, it means that this fragment is going to be probably the most prevalent fragment because it\u0026rsquo;s the most stable fragment and therefore the one with the highest probability of being produced. And so the base peak is really representative of your most stable cation.\nAnd that is going to be something where you're looking for resonance or hyper conjugation. So any type of tertiary cations are going to be ideal, allylic cations would be ideal because of the resonance stabilized positions. So that is the result of the base peak and the relative intensity, we say this is 100, the base peak, and everything else is in comparison to it when we're looking at this, and that tells us about the relative stability of some of the other cations that we might find. Alright, so that\u0026rsquo;s a quick primer on the difference between the M+ (M plus) or the parent peak, which is your molar mass and the base peak, has nothing to do with the molar mass. The tallest peak simply has to do with the most stable cation that is likely going to form in the process of this fragmenting when you remove portions of the molecule.\n"},{"id":94,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-01-Theory/M+_M+1_M+2/","title":"The M+, M+1 and M+2 Peaks","section":"Part I Theory","content":"M+ peak represents the compound. It is often referred to as the parent peak.\nM+1 peak represents the compound with isotope. The chance of finding a C-13 is one in 100. C-13 and N-15 can be responsible for M+1 peak. M+2 peak represents the compound having either chloride or bromide isotope.\n\rToday we\u0026rsquo;re going to take a look at some more spectroscopy understanding the M+, M+1, and M+2 signals that can sometimes show up on a mass spec. So this is going to usually involve when you\u0026rsquo;re doing organic spectroscopy, although it\u0026rsquo;s not limited to that. But this is where this is going to be geared towards as far as this discussion here.\nM+ Peak #  Which is the most common peak of the bunch that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be discussing here, in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory, you should always have an M+ peak with your mass spec, it is often referred to as the parent peak, because it is the peak that will represent the compound you\u0026rsquo;re actually analyzing in the mass spectrometer. So what is the compound? It is only had a single electron removed is representing is the mass of the compound that has been put into the instrument. Now, typically, this peak is going to be clustered in with the highest grouping of peaks in the highest M to Z ratio. So what that means is if we look at m to Z ratio, which is mass to charge, and if it\u0026rsquo;s just plus, it\u0026rsquo;s a one, so it\u0026rsquo;s just referring to the mass here, if you take a look at your mass spec, and you go up to the area where you see the last grouping of peaks, usually the peak that has the highest intensity out of that grouping is going to be the parents peak. Now it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s going to be the tallest peak in the entire mass spec, we call that the base peak. If you go up to that region, where you find the highest set of peaks, the one that is the highest out of that group is usually considered the parent peak, which we again referred to as the M+ peak. Alright, now usually what this means is, this peak will represent your individual molecule with the most common set of mass isotopes present. So for instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with an organic compound, it will most likely be dealing with a compound that is completely made out of C-12, hydrogen, N-14, O-16. So as I\u0026rsquo;m listing off these isotopes, these are the most common isotopes. For instance, if I have carbons present, there\u0026rsquo;s about a 99% chance that it\u0026rsquo;s a C-12 atom. And so most of the molecules I would expect, that I am injecting into this mass spectrometer are going to be made up of carbon twelves. Every one and 100 might be a C-13. And that leads us into the next topic here, which is the M+1 peak.\nM+1 Peak #  So keeping in mind that we\u0026rsquo;re really talking about the mass to charge ratio, when we say M+1, it represents the fact that our mass because the charge is typically going to be one when we\u0026rsquo;re using M to Z ratio, the mass is simply one amu, or one Dalton in whatever unit you want to use. It\u0026rsquo;s one atomic unit heavier. The parent molecule contains a single atom in it, that is going to have an isotope with one mass unit heavier than most of the common isotopes. So again, a C-13, instead of a C-12. The larger the molecule structure, the more likely this peak is to occur and the more prominent the M+1 peak will become. Now this is nothing but a numbers game when you look at it statistically. So if I have a relatively small organic compound, let\u0026rsquo;s say it only has five carbons that I want to analyze, while the chance of finding a C-13 is one in 100. So there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a pretty small chance that out of those five carbons, one of them is going to be a C-13. But as I increase in size, so let\u0026rsquo;s say that now I\u0026rsquo;m starting to analyze a compound that has 40 carbons. Well, now there\u0026rsquo;s a much more higher likelihood or a greater likelihood that I could potentially see a C-13. In one of those 40 carbons, since the odds are about one in 100, that a C-13 will randomly occur. Inorganic compounds, as long as you have a somewhat modest size, then you will usually see an M+1 peak. And that is most commonly due to a C-13 isotope. It\u0026rsquo;s about a one in 100 chance. So you can easily see M+1 peaks in most organic compounds provided, I would say they have at least somewhere between five to seven carbons. Now, nitrogen is another possibility if you have a compound that is rich in nitrogen, because remember, organic compounds are gonna to have far more carbon than nitrogen most often, he but if you do have an organic compound that\u0026rsquo;s relatively rich in nitrogen, you could potentially see a N-15, that is resulting in a M+1 peak, but this is less likely than the C-13. So if you look at the natural abundance, the nitrogen has about a one in 200 chance of becoming an N-15 instead of the one in 100 chance of the C-13. So again, nitrogen could be responsible for an M+1 peak. But if there\u0026rsquo;s carbon present, especially if there\u0026rsquo;s more carbon than there is nitrogen, most of the time, the M+1 peak is going to be due to the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s C-13 Present. Right now, if you are studying non organic compounds, or potentially, if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a weird organic compound that has a whole lot of either silicone or sulfur, then you may also see an M+1 peak. In fact, silicone, if I am not mistaken, has about a one in 20 chance, it\u0026rsquo;s about a 4% for the M+1 isotope of silicone.\nSo let's take a look here before we go to M+2, we have caffeine this is the mass spectra for caffeine. And what I want you to notice here is if we come over the grouping of peaks right here, are considered to be the highest group of peaks as far as the `M to Z ratio` is concerned. So of that grouping, we can see one of them is far taller as far as the relative intensity is concerned than the others. And that is this one right here. This is the M+ peak at 194. So that's the M+ for caffeine. And then if you take a look, it's pretty easy to see this here, we have a peak right next to it. Now it's not labeled as 195. But that's what it would be, then this would be the M+1 peak. And then you can also have the M+2 and that is there. It's very tiny relative to the M+1. And we'll see why in a minute. particularly has to do with as you continue to go up the ranks like that, there's less and less chance that you're going to see these types of peaks now that could be due to two C-13. So although it's less likely, you'd have to have a whole lot of them. it's probably due to oxygen because oxygen can give an M+2 peak. M+2 Peak #  Alright, so the M+2 peak, the two most common occurrences of M+2 by far are due to chlorine and bromine presence in a compound. So these are very obvious even more so than the M+1 C-13 peaks. So chlorine has a set of isotopes, Cl-35, and Cl-37. The 35 is the more common one, and the 37 is less. So it\u0026rsquo;s about a 75 to 25% mix, or a three to one ratio. Alright, so if chlorine is present, the M+ peak is going to be about three times as intense as your M+2 peak. So if your M+2 peak is about a third the size of your parent peak go up and look at caffeine. If you had one that was about the third the size of this peak, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be very evident in the M+2 spot, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a pretty large peak there. now, bromine, you have bromine 79 and bromine 81. They are in a one to one ratio, relatively speaking for isotopes. And so you will see an M+ that has an equal intensity peak at M+2, they will be almost dead even with one another as far as the statistical occurrence of them. so chlorine and bromine are the two most common sources of M+2 peaks, especially ones that are very prominent that we can easily see. Now, if an organic molecule is sufficiently large enough, and it has to be pretty large in order to pull this off, it could potentially have an M+2 peak due to two C-13s in one molecule. Now again, the chance here is one in 100. So now you\u0026rsquo;re trying to take that one and 100 chance and say it\u0026rsquo;s going to happen twice in the same molecule. You are getting into shaky territory in terms of statistics, it\u0026rsquo;s not that it\u0026rsquo;s impossible, but it starts to become pretty improbable. Unless, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a very large organic molecule where you\u0026rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of carbons. And it\u0026rsquo;s certainly more possible at that point that you could see several C-13s that might be present. Same thing for a C-13 and a N-15. So we could have one C-13 and one N-15. This would be even less likely because N-15 is harder to get a hold of than C-13. So to have both of them in the same molecule, again, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be pretty rare, you would have to have a pretty big molecule with a lot of carbon and a lot of nitrogen to pull this off. But it is possible.\nThe other possibilities that we can have are going to be less likely than the halogens, but they will still be more likely than the C-13 and N-15 examples that we just discussed. So these could include oxygen, we have O-16 and O-18, the silicone and the sulfur because silicon and sulfur both have M+1 and M+2 isomers or isotopes that we can take a look at.\nSo here's an example with benzyl chloride and then we're going to take a look at benzyl bromide. So you can see here's again, the grouping in the highest `M to Z ratio` area 126 would be the parent peak, because it is most definitely the tallest of the group. And I can see about a third that size is 128. And that would be the chlorine isotopes that are behaving there. So then if I go down, and I take a look at the benzyl bromide, here I see 170 and 172. And look at that they're almost equal in terms of their height to one another. And again, here is the highest group in terms of the `M to Z ratio`."},{"id":95,"href":"/docs/97-Raman/Part-1-Theory/Thermo_Principle/","title":"Raman Spectroscopy Principle by Thermo","section":"Part I Raman Spectroscopy Principle","content":"This is a transcript of the following video.\n\r\r\r \r\r Okay, so now let\u0026rsquo;s look at the basic idea behind the classic theory of Raman scattering or Raman spectroscopy.\nTo begin with, and this is something we\u0026rsquo;re going to keep coming back to multiple times, as we talk about the spectroscopy, molecules 1 can exist in various energy levels. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about vibrations here. So this is going to be a vibrational energy level equals zero, or we\u0026rsquo;re going to call it the ground state. And then there can be various excited states, which we\u0026rsquo;ll just call v equals one, v equals two. And an infrared spectroscopy, we just take from v equals zero to v equals one, we absorb a photon. And there we are, we\u0026rsquo;re in the energy level.\nBut in Raman, something a little more complicated happens. What happens in Raman is that we will shine a source on to the sample. In this case, this is going to be called a laser νL. And that laser frequency is going to when the molecule is struck by it, it\u0026rsquo;s going to excite that molecule up to something called a virtual state. Now that virtual state is not a real energy level, it\u0026rsquo;s just whatever energy that laser happens to have. And the molecule is raised up to that virtual state and it\u0026rsquo;s transient, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stay there for very long. Now, once it\u0026rsquo;s there, one of two things can happen.\n  The first thing is it can scatter that light right back and go right back to the ground state. And this is going to be the νR. In this case, $$νR=νL$$. And the reason I call it R is because this is called Rayleight light, or Rayleight scattering. The Rayleight scattering comes out with the same energy that went in with. There\u0026rsquo;s no real energy interchange between the system here.\n  The other thing that can happen, though, is that the molecule can scatter the light, but while it\u0026rsquo;s scattering the light, or as that light is impinging on the virtual state, when the molecule is in the virtual state, it can take a little bit of the energy out, and the energy that it takes out gives it this excitation. This we\u0026rsquo;re going to call νS, and critically νS, which is called the Stokes line, and hence the S. $$νS = νL - ν0→1$$ 2 . What we do know, we know νL, that\u0026rsquo;s the laser, that\u0026rsquo;s our source, that\u0026rsquo;s the energy we put in. The spectrometer, as we\u0026rsquo;ll see in a later video, measures νS. It measures this scattered or Stokes photon. So we know these two. So if we solve this equation, we can find this energy. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re interested in. This is the energy of the molecule, and this is what the Raman is looking at.\n  Now, it is also possible for the molecule to initially start out in an excited state. Now that is νL again, it\u0026rsquo;s the same νL but since there\u0026rsquo;s a spacing here, it actually goes to a higher virtual state. And from that higher virtual state, the molecule can then scatter all the way back to the ground state. Notice in this case, and we\u0026rsquo;ll call this νAS, that this photon right here, which is called an anti Stokes photon, is higher in energy than the energy that came in, because the molecule gave up some energy. So if we look here, we have $$νAS = νL + ν0→1$$.\nSo you can see these are the three standard Raman events:\n The Rayleight scatter, in which case no energy is interchanged. The photon in, the photon out. As we\u0026rsquo;ll see, as we go on, this is an extremely intense photon, and actually can cause some problems, because it\u0026rsquo;s so bright, so intense, that it can actually damage the detector, if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something about it. We\u0026rsquo;ll see what we do about that later. The Stokes photon is going to be by far and away the most common that we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at where some of the energy has been removed from the laser. And that energy is equal to this vibrational excitation and the anti Stokes photon, which is hired energy, as we\u0026rsquo;ll see when we talk about out fluorescence, it has certain advantages, it would be nice to be able to use this. But because of something called the Boltzmann distribution, this is not always that useful.  So that\u0026rsquo;s the basic idea behind Raman. The three different scatters Rayleight Stokes and anti Stokes, the interchange of energy. And the key underlying fact, we are looking at a vibrational excitation, that vibrational excitation is the same thing that you\u0026rsquo;re looking at when you\u0026rsquo;re doing infrared spectroscopy, where you\u0026rsquo;d be going from this level to this level, it\u0026rsquo;s the same type of thing. As we\u0026rsquo;ll see, there\u0026rsquo;s different selection rules and different kinds of vibrations that we\u0026rsquo;re looking at. But nevertheless, it\u0026rsquo;s the same information. So we\u0026rsquo;re looking at that that excitation.\n/* image and text side-by-side */\r* {\rbox-sizing: border-box;\r}\r.row {\rmargin-left:-5px;\rmargin-right:-5px;\r}\r.column {\rfloat: left;\rpadding: 5px; /* space between two tables*/\r}\r/* Clearfix (clear floats) */\r.row::after {\rcontent: \"\";\rclear: both;\rdisplay: table;\r}\r/* end of the setting for two tables side-by-side */\r    It states molecules, not electrons.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n ν0→1 is called transition energy.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":96,"href":"/docs/50-MS-Based-Metabolomics/Notes/xcms_arguments/","title":"Arguments available in xcmsSet()","section":"Notes","content":"I list a number of arguments available in xcmsSet().\nArguments for Feature Detection\r\r\rArguments\n\rDefinition\n\r\r\rmethod\r\rcentWave: Highly sensitive feature detection using a peak density and wavelet based method.

The retention time correction and grouping parameters are simultaneously optimized. Grouping results in peak groups by combining peaks with similar masses and retention times from different LC-MS runs.  Simultaneous optimization of retention time correction and grouping is necessary because grouping is required for the assessment of the retention time correction step, which in turn can improve the grouping. This semisequential approach additionally decreases the overall computing time. The different levels for the XCMS parameters are determined by a design of experiments approach. Box-Behnken designs (BBD) serve as basis to generate the DoEs. BBD is a three level incomplete factorial design for fitting a second order response surface model. Three levels denote that for each parameter three different evenly spaced values are tested. The two outer values define a range, the middle value a center point. In contrast to a full factorial design, BBD does not test all factorial combinations, making it highly efficient [19]. For the default levels used by IPO in the first DoE see Additional file 1. To evaluate the result of the DoE, one score for peak picking and one score for retention time correction and grouping is used.\n"},{"id":98,"href":"/docs/50-MS-Based-Metabolomics/Notes/","title":"Notes","section":"Mass Spectrometry Based Metabolomics","content":"Here I take notes while I practice metabolomics applications.\n"},{"id":99,"href":"/docs/50-MS-Based-Metabolomics/Notes/Notes/","title":"Notes","section":"Notes","content":"Figure : \rWhen loading xcms, the following packages are loaded.\n\u0026gt; library(xcms)\rLoading required package: BiocParallel\rLoading required package: MSnbase\rLoading required package: BiocGenerics\rLoading required package: Biobase\rLoading required package: mzR\rLoading required package: Rcpp\rLoading required package: S4Vectors\rLoading required package: stats4\rLoading required package: ProtGenerics\r"},{"id":100,"href":"/docs/50-MS-Based-Metabolomics/Notes/xcms_methods/","title":"xcms Methods and Parameters","section":"Notes","content":"Figure : \rThe first \u0026lsquo;xcmsSet\u0026rsquo;-method \u0026lsquo;centWave\u0026rsquo; deals with peak picking.

Tadeo]\nSummary [1] #  samples or extracts are percolated through the cartridge and the compounds are sorbed on the solid phase materials, which have been previously conditioned and activated (Zhang et al., 2012). Then the interferences are removed by prewashing by organic solvents while the analytes are retained on the sorbents. More frequently, the interferences are retained in the cartridge and the analytes pass through and are collected for analysis.\nProcedures [2] #  A typical SPE sequence includes the activation of the sorbent bed (wetting), removal of the excess of activation solvent (conditioning), application of the sample, removal of interferences (cleanup) and water, elution of the sorbed analytes, and reconstitution of the extract [3]. Exact conditions are usually specified by the manufacturer, and may vary significantly in types of solvents used for conditioning and elution. A general procedure for using SPE cartridges is as follows [4]:\n Wash the cartridge with a small amount of relatively nonpolar solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate, acetone), followed by a relatively polar solvent (e.g., methanol), and finally water. Without letting the cartridge become dry, pass the water sample (e.g., 1 L) through the column under vacuum at a relatively fast rate (e.g., 15 mL=min). If the water sample contains an appreciable amount of suspended solids, filter the sample to remove suspended solids before loading. After the sample is loaded, wash the cartridge with a small amount of water and dry the cartridge by passing air for a short time. Elute the SPE cartridge with the same solvents used at the preparation step, except in a reversed order. The eluate is dried with a small amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate and further evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The residue is recovered in a small amount of solvent appropriate for GC or LC analysis.

Having the capability to retain compounds by two modes of interaction during SPE is useful when a large number of analytes with different properties are of interest.\nMost mixed mode phases are bonded silica or polymeric reversed phase materials with an ion-exchange group bonded to it. Cation exchange phases like EVOLUTE EXPRESS CX usually have a negatively charged sulfonate group covalently bonded to the reversed phase backbone. Anion exchange phases like EVOLUTE EXPRESS AX typically have a positively charged quaternary ammonium group. Figure 1 shows the structure of both EVOLUTE EXPRESS CX and EVOLUTE EXPRESS AX.\n\rFigure 1: Chemical structures of both cation exchange phase EVOLUTE EXPRESS CX and anion exchange phase EVOLUTE EXPRESS AX.\r\r\rThese are strong acid or strong base cation or anion exchange phases, meaning that the sulfonate or quaternary ammonium groups remain charged over the entire pH range.\nSo, you’re asking – what does these charges do for me? #  It allows you to adjust the pH of your sample, based on the pKa of the analytes of interest, to make them positively or negatively charged so that you can retain them by cation or anion exchange in addition to (or instead of) reversed phase. Ion exchange is a much stronger retention mechanism and allows the use of more aggressive wash steps to clean up the sample. It is especially good for removing hydrophobic interfering compounds with a strong organic wash. If all of your analytes of interest are retained by cation or anion exchange, 100% methanol, acetonitrile or hexane can often be used as the organic wash without eluting your analytes of interest.\nIf all of your compounds could be positively or negatively charged – life would be easy!\nBasic compounds #  For positively charged (basic) compounds, you just adjust your sample pH to 2 pH units below the pKa (usually with an acid). This turns the positive charge of the molecules “on” so they can be retained by cation exchange. Load the sample onto the cation exchange SPE phase, wash with acid (often the same solution you used to pretreat your sample), wash with 100% organic solvent, then elute with basic organic solvent at least pH 2 units above the pKa of your sample. This turns the charge of your molecules “off” and disrupts the ion exchange retention, releasing the compounds from the SPE phase.\nAcidic compounds #  Anion exchange for acidic compounds works in reverse. Adjust the pH to 2 units above the pKa, usually with a base, to negatively charge the compounds, load, wash with base, wash with organic solvent, and elute with acidified organic solvent to “turn off” the negative charge.\nSuper simple!\nSigh. Life is usually not that simple. If only every assay had compounds that could be all positively or negatively charged and that was the only interaction with the SPE phase. Unfortunately, most analytical methods have groups of acidic, basic and neutral compounds that may have a positive or negative charge, or be neutral at a single pH. Also, part of the molecule could be charged and be retained by ion exchange while another part of the molecule can exhibit reversed phase retention.\nWhat’s an analytical chemist to do? That’s where mixed mode SPE can help you out. Because these phases are mixed mode, a polymeric reversed phase material with cation or anion exchange moieties bonded to it, you have the ability to retain compounds by ion exchange and reversed phase! This is great for large panels with acidic, basic and neutral compounds.\nHere’s the general strategy for a polymeric reversed phase ion exchange SPE method, step-by-step: #   Know your compounds! Look up the logP and pKa of the compounds in your assay. I can’t emphasize this enough! If you don’t know the properties of the compounds, you don’t know how they will be retained, and your method development will take a lot longer. If there are a large number of basic analytes that can be positively charged, proceed with mixed mode cation exchange. If you have more acidic compounds that can be negatively charged, move forward with mixed mode anion exchange. Some compounds will be charged and some will be neutral. That’s ok. You’re using both mechanisms for retention. Find the pH where the majority of your compounds will be either positively or negatively charged (remember the pH “rule of 2”). The remaining compounds will be neutral. This may mean adjusting to a very low or very high pH to ionize the majority of compounds. This is ok – polymeric phases are stable over the entire pH range. Make sure your all of your compounds are stable at the pH you choose. Prepare a solution and pretreat your samples so that they are at the pH where the majority of your analytes will be positively or negatively charged. Load samples onto the correct mixed mode SPE phase. Do an aqueous wash. Often the solution used to pretreat the sample will work well for the aqueous wash step, but sometimes other washes will need to be evaluated. Just make sure you don’t move too far from the pH where your samples are charged, or you may \u0026ldquo;turn off\u0026rdquo; the charge and elute them. Do an organic wash. Try several washes with increasing amounts of organic:aqueous solvent and see what happens to your compounds retained by reversed phase. Chooses the highest ratio of organic to aqueous that provides good recovery of all compounds. Dry the columns for several minutes. Elute with basic or acidic organic solvent. Some elution solvents that work well with EVOLUTE EXPRESS CX are combinations of methylene chloride or ethyl acetate with 2-propanol or methanol and 2% ammonium hydroxide, or methanol or acetonitrile with 2% ammonium hydroxide. For EVOLUTE EXPRESS AX, methanol or acetonitrile with 2-5% formic acid is a good starting point. Dry the samples under nitrogen, reconstitute, and analyze.

The spray passes through a heated ceramic tube, where the droplets are fully vaporized. The resulting gas/vapor mixture is then passed over a corona discharge needle, where the solvent vapor is ionized to create reagent gas ions.\nFor successful APCI, the analyte must be volatile and thermally stable and the mobile phase must be suitable for gas-phase acid–base reactions.\nTo vaporize the solvent and analyte, the APCI source is typically operated at vaporizer temperatures of 400 to 500 0C.\nAPCI enables the analysis of compounds that resisted converting to gas phase ions using ESI, that is, the less polar and more volatile ones.\nAPCI transfers neutral analytes into the gas phase by vaporizing the LC eluent contained within a nonconductive capillary inserted in a coaxial pneumatic nebulizer through which a gas is added to assist the ionization process. The mixture of gas and nebulized eluent passes through a heated zone that assists the solvent evaporation and the fine droplets are converted into desolvated molecules in the gas phase.\nThe desolvated analyte molecules are then ionized via chemical ionization; the transfer of charged species between a reagent ion and a target molecule to produce a target ion that can be mass analyzed.\nThe corona-discharge needle in the APCI source produces a stream of electrons that ionizes the atmosphere surrounding the corona electrode, which consists mainly of nebulizer and drying gases (typically nitrogen and/or air), the vapor generated from the HPLC eluent, and the analyte molecules. The process starts by ionizing nitrogen and finishes with protonated water, water clusters, and solvent clusters as possible reagent ions.\nFor successful APCI, the analyte must be volatile and thermally stable and the mobile phase must be suitable for gas-phase acid–base reactions. For example, when working in positive ion mode, the proton affinity of the analyte must be higher than the proton affinity of the eluent: that is, the analyte can acquire a proton from the protonated solvent.\nSince water cluster ions are a major source of reagent ions, the proton affinity of these clusters relative to analyte ions will have a profound effect on sensitivity. Similarly, the use of certain modifiers added to the mobile phase to enhance LC separation (e.g., triethylamine) can be the source of considerable ion suppression in APCI. A strong base will receive protons from the reactant ions to form their protonated forms. Subsequent proton transfer will occur only if the analyte is more basic than the modifier. Although the choice of the most appropriate interface as well as detection polarity are based on analyte polarity and LC operating conditions, many classes of compounds perform well using either technique and sometimes in both ion modes, whereas, for other compounds, the choice is more restricted. Interfaces are selected based on individual preference derived from experience and available techniques as well as the magnitude of any matrix effects.\nAlthough there are a great number of examples of the use of APCI for pesticide residue analysis for both environmental and food applications, including some pioneering early work, more recently the technique appears to be left in the wake of ES ionization’s overwhelming popularity. This may be related to the increasing number and wider range of pesticides currently sought but perhaps also reflects the improvements in source and probe design for ES not yet paralleled with APCI.\nThe choice between ES and APCI is irrelevant when using the recently introduced multimode sources, which deliver simultaneous ES ionization and APCI.\np79, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

Thus, I want to know which ion pair reagents I could use.\n William Letter\nAs a general rule, we try to avoid using any / all ion pairing reagents with LC-MS or LC-MS/MS systems. This is based on several decades of use and research. They tend to contaminate the entire LC source for days, weeks, months to years resulting in higher than normal background levels and additional noise (because they bind to just about everything in the system). *TFA is by far one of the most common and worst of the group. Many less experienced users transfer LC methods to the LC/MS systems without first modifying them for use. TFA is grossly overused in HPLC method development (often for no reason at all, accept that the person before them used it! ). It is far too strong an acid for most applications (always use the lowest possible concentration that is needed) and goes bad quickly when exposed to light and air resulting in other contaminates being introduced to the system (very noticeable with a MS system).\nThe best advice I would share is, if practical, to re-develop your HPLC method to not use ion pairing reagents. Perhaps HILIC or one of the newer highly retentive aqueous columns might be applicable to your samples? This is worth investigating first, before transferring the method to an LC/MS system. When mobile phase acidification is needed, please consider using high purity Formic Acid in place of acetic, TFA or propionic acids. Formic acid is milder than TFA, yet causes no long term problems of contamination. It is also better in the low UV region than Acetic Acid or TFA are, esp for use in tandem with UV detection modes too (DAD-MS, very useful).\nIf you are unable to find a replacement for the ion pairing reagent, understand that decontaminating the MS source (and LC system, column and flow path) may be both time consuming and costly. Systems that do use it are often put aside as \u0026ldquo;dedicated LC/MS systems for those samples\u0026rdquo; (e.g. proteomics), and regular samples are analyzed on other \u0026ldquo;IP (ion pair) free\u0026rdquo; MS systems. Also, be cautious about using any fluorinated compounds with an HPLC that uses a modern in-line degasser as many are NOT compatible with those types of compounds (resulting in possible contamination and hardware damage).\nHere are a few related articles that may be of interest:\n \u0026ldquo;Popular LC/MS and HPLC Volatile Mobile Phase Buffers\u0026rdquo;; https://hplctips.blogspot.com/2014/06/popular-hplc-volatile-mobile-phase.html \u0026ldquo;An Often Ignored HPLC \u0026amp; LC/MS Contamination Source.

For unavaoidable reasons we have been using Dimethylhexylamine (DMHA) as an ion pairing reagent in our LC MS system and since joining i have beein seeing its peak in the background for each and every single analysis performed on the system. Hence trying everything else before using ion pairing reagent is a must.\n William Letter\nDMHA is another stubborn binder. Routine washing with MeOH/DH20 (~ 50/50, or 40/60) with some ammonia (i.e. less than 25 mM ammonium formate or ammonium acetate) may help to slowly remove it over time. If you do use ammonium, then you will also generate ammonium adducts too, but these should go away over time. We alternate the wash solution from acidified (formic) to basic to reduce the level of contamination. Be sure and remove the column used from the system and install a restriction capillary in its place when flushing (put it aside, as it will continue to contaminate the whole system. Label it as noted below). *Remember, columns are consumable items.\nIf you have not done so already, please label any/all HPLC columns which are used with IP reagents to keep them separate. Use them only with IP methods. Once exposed to these agents, their surface is often permanently modified/changed so different chromatography results may be obtained using them (IOW: you may not be able to duplicate results run on the column from before it was used with the reagents).\n Navid J. Ayon\nDr. Letter,\nThank you so much for such valuable advise. We have been using our column both for IP and without IP analysis and that might explain why we sometimes don’t get reproducible results. I would keep this in mind from now on and try to talk to the supervisor if we can afford to keep columns separate. Also, we have been using 25% methanol as washing solvent. Do you think we should go to a higher methanol percentage. My supervisor is reluctant to go higher as he says that methanol gives a higher pressure. Also I have never used a mild basic solvents to wash the system which is something I can also discuss with the supervisor. Once again thank you so much for you time and help.\nSincerely,\nNavid\n Michael Toner\nWe have avoided ion pair reagents because of all of the articles on the topic of using ion pairing reagents in a LC-MS. All of them negative. Learn from others mistakes. For HPLC with other detection ion pairing reagents are acceptable but you need to designate the column to limit it for that particular ion pairing reagent.\n Markus Christ\nHi Ana,\nI can only agree with the previous speakers. Ion pair reagents are usually poison for a LC/MS system. However, there are exceptions. We use e.g. an LC/MS system for the analysis of oligonucleotides and have had very good experiences with HFIP (hexafluoroisopropanol) / TEA (triethylamine). Very nice chromatography and really good signal intensity. However, we only use this system for oligonucleotides, but I cannot say anything about possible negative effects on other analytes.\nRegards\nMarkus\n William Letter\nA word of caution about using mobile phases with HFIP in them. If your HPLC system utilizes an inline vacuum degasser module, then please avoid using any fluorinated compounds with the degasser module. IN addition to the system wide contamination that may result from using such compounds, we have sometimes seen the chemicals damage the vacuum degasser modules over time.\nFor more information on this topic: \u0026ldquo;An Often Ignored HPLC \u0026amp; LC/MS Contamination Source. Did you check your Vacuum Degasser?\u0026quot;; https://hplctips.blogspot.com/2015/08/an-often-ignored-hplc-lcms.html\nMarkus, you are correct. There are definitely a few key application areas where we do indeed use these nasty IP reagents and oligonucleotides is one of them. In that case, we accept the fact that the system will be contaminated and ideally, you would dedicate it to that application (as the cleanup needed to remove the IP will be very costly and time consuming). When that is the case, we try to use as low a concentration of the IP as possible that still gets the job done in a reliable way.\n Markus Christ\nHi Wiliam,\ninteresting infos related to degassers.\nFrom which manufacturer do you use degasser? We use an Agilent system in case of oligonucleotide analysis. So far (since about 2 years) we had no degasser problems with HFIP.\nRegards\nMarkus\n William Letter\nThe cautionary statement applies to all vacuum degassers which use standard \u0026lsquo;Teflon AF\u0026rsquo; degassing membranes or tubing. The manufacturers clearly state these these chambers should not be used with chemicals such as Hexafluoroisopropanol. Special chambers are needed for use with special chemicals. \u0026lsquo;We\u0026rsquo; have services all brands of HPLC vacuum degassers (for \u0026gt; 25 years) and observed an increase in the number of problems when the more porous Teflon AF material were introduced (~ 2003). Teflon AF degassing membranes are found in almost all modern degasser modules (e.g. Shimadzu, Agilent, Thermo, Waters\u0026hellip;) and awareness of which types of solvents are safe (and compatible) to use with the specific version of the vacuum chamber used should be reviewed before using them.\nSome manufacturers switched over to the new degassing material exclusively, while others only use it in certain degasser models. While the new degassing material has much higher degassing efficiency (allowing for smaller chamber volumes), the high porosity allows water and many other chemicals to pass into the vacuum system, sometimes resulting in contamination of the mobile phase and/or damage to the degasser. Additionally, fluorinated compounds are soluble with the membrane material. We have seen the degassing membrane leach into the mobile phase and also damage the vacuum system too.\nIn HP/Agilent\u0026rsquo;s case, one variation of the latest model G4225A uses Teflon AF. Take precautions if you are using that version, as we do not recommend it be used with any fluorinated compounds, THF, chloroform, hexanes and so on. BTW: Please do not use any model G1379A degasser with THF, chloroform, dichloromethane, heptane and hexanes as the chamber casings are made from PEEK and incompatible with many common HPLC solvents (solvent vapors).\nMost of the older models such as the G1322A and the early versions of the G1379B (not the later models) came from the factory with the less porous standard Teflon membranes (not Teflon AF) and are generally safe for use with many HPLC solvents and chemicals such as HFIP. If you are using one of the std models with pure Teflon inside, then the use of fluorinated compounds carries the conventional warnings only. *Never assume your degasser is working fine. As they age, they all start to break down inside and contaminate the mobile phase. Regular service of the vacuum degasser (~ 4 to 5 years) should be undertaken to keep them clean and operating within specification over time. They require maintenance just like the rest of the HPLC modules, though for some reason (probably because they are \u0026ldquo;black boxes\u0026rdquo;) are ignored for many years by most users (until they stop working or they contaminate the flow path). In HPLC systems which use inline vacuum degassers, preventative maintenance is critical to maintain reliable operation.\nIf you have any specific questions regarding vacuum chamber compatibility, please feel free to send me a private message (through RG), stating the exact brand and model number and I will try to assist you.\n William Letter\nMarkus: Which degasser model(s) do you use on your HPLC?\n Markus Christ\nWilliam: The system for the oligonucleotide analysis uses a G4204A QuatPump. The pump has a degasser on board.\nRegards Markus\n William Letter\nHello Markus: The 1290-series G4204A Pump DOES have a built-in vacuum degasser with Teflon AF degassing membranes inside so please be cautious when using IP reagents, any fluorinated solvents, solvents such as THF and chloroform which are not compatible with it (we service a fair number of them which show internal damage from not following these guidelines or from not having them serviced every 5 years). *Agilent\u0026rsquo;s solution is to replace the entire degasser module ($$$$), but can professionally clean and repair the degasser modules in these pumps for a fraction of what they charge.\n Michael Toner\nWilliam, as an aside, is that service contract on the degass unit extra bucks? We get annual service contracts with Agilent and I have never seen them work on the degass unit.\n William Letter\nMichael, I can not speak for Agilent (I do not, and have never been an employee of Agilent Technologies), but most instrument vendor service contracts cover the specific modules mentioned in the contract. In the case of a 1290-series G4204A pump, with an integrated degasser, the degasser is a component part of the pump, so should be covered.\n The vacuum degasser modules (integrated and standalone versions) are one of the most neglected parts of the modern HPLC system. They have a limited lifetime and require service every 5 years or so (if well maintained; sooner if abused). As they deteriorate, they contaminate the internal vacuum path which then contaminates the mobile phase (they are a common source of ghost peaks). **We never had these issues when helium sparging was used. The vacuum degassers are \u0026ldquo;black boxes\u0026rdquo; to most, which is why most vendors do not repair them until they burst or fail in a dramatic way (instead they \u0026lsquo;service\u0026rsquo; them by replacing the whole degassing module) . In fact, most manufacturers do not train their service engineers to diagnose or repair them (it is not worth their time, which is true, and cheaper for them to just replace the whole degasser module, just as they do with other parts). A $5K USD \u0026ldquo;part\u0026rdquo; is thought to be of little concern when a complete HPLC system costs $50,000 to $100,000 USD. Full disclosure to those reading. My company, Chiralizer Services, LLC (USA) has been using, designing, building and servicing HPLC systems for several decades so we have first-hand knowledge of the damaged caused to them from \u0026lsquo;real-world\u0026rsquo; use. We are not affiliated with any of the major instrument manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s, though we do have a division which specializes in the professional servicing of ALL brands of HPLC degasser modules.   Holli Palmer\nUsing HFIP/TEA (or other amine) based IP mobile phases should be fine to use thru an inline degasser if, at the end of the analysis, you flush that mobile phase off the system. So long as the system is not sitting in an HFIP solution, any potential for damage should be minimal.\nOf course, flushing mobile phases off of a system quickly should be standard practice, unless you\u0026rsquo;re using straight water/organic mixture. Mobile phases can be acidic, basic, salty, 100% aqueous, etc, all of which can cause their own set of problems if left too long on a system.\nTimothy S Collier\nThe most commonly utilized ion-pair reagents are formic or acetic acids. TFA will certainly suppress ionization, so use sparingly (\nOpposite opinions #   Marcos Steola\nHi Ana. For LC-MS you must use only volatile reagents. For ion pair you could use trifluoroacetic acid, perfluoropropionic acid or perfluorobutanoic acid. These compounds will work as a ion pair, but take care about trifluoroacetic acid, it is could supress ionization in your source.\n Isam Eldin Hussein Elgailani\nDear Sir. Concerning your issue about the ion pair chromatography reagents that are compatible with LC-MS. The ion-pair reagents for basic samples in LC-MS analysis are supplied as 0.5 M aqueous solutions. The solution can be used as an acidic mobile phase after dilution with the LC solvents (acetonitrile/water or methanol/water) to 5 mM. Since the basic substances are ionized under the acidic conditions, they are facilitated to form an ion-pair.\nFor LC-MS:\n(Trifluoroacetic Acid) (ca. 0.5mol/L in Water) ………………… 10mL\n(Pentafluoropropionic Acid) (ca. 0.5mol/L in Water) ………… 10mL\n(Heptafluorobutyric Acid) (ca. 0.5mol/L in Water) …………… 10mL\n(Nonafluorovaleric Acid) (ca. 0.5mol/L in Water) ……………… 10mL\n(Undecafluorohexanoic Acid) (ca. 5mmol)…………………… 1sample.\nI think the following below links may help you in your analysis:\n https://www.tcichemicals.com/a-cmn/en/common/support-download/brochure/ion-pair_reagents_for_hplc.pdf\n https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac9917240?journalCode=ancham\n http://www.waters.com/webassets/cms/library/docs/720002791en.pdf\nThanks\n"},{"id":119,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-01-Theory/Characteristics_API/","title":"Characteristics of ESI and APCI","section":"Part I Theory","content":"Atmospheric Pressure Ionization includes ESI and APCI.\n\rFigure 1: Application area of two ionization interfaces: ESI and APCI. ESI is more suited for polar molecules or compounds with a high molecular weight. [1]\r\r\r\rFigure 2: Schematic overview of two ionization interfaces: ESI (A) and APCI (B). (A) In ESI, ionization in the liquid phase (and perhaps also in the gas phase) is followed by desorption (i.e. vaporization because of electrical potential, in ESI possibly assisted by heat and/or gas). (B) In APCI, vaporization by heat is followed by ionization of reagent molecules at the corona needle. The ionized reagent molecules finally can transfer their charge to the target molecules. [2]  \r ES and APCI are soft methods of ionization as very little residual energy is retained by the analyte on ionization. The major disadvantage of the techniques is that very little fragmentation is produced. The mass spectra generated by either technique are typically dominated by protonated or deprotonated molecules, [M+H]+ or [M-H]-, depending on the ion mode used and adducts (e.g., [M+Na]+, [M+NH3]+, [M+HCOO]-).\nThis only provides information on molecular weight. This is very different from the information-rich spectra obtained with EI. For better selectivity through MS/MS or elucidation of structure, fragmentation is needed. Possible fragmentation techniques include \u0026ldquo;in-source\u0026rdquo; CID, CID in the collision cell of a tandem-type instrument and fragmentation in an ion trap. One of the major problems encountered using LC-MS with ES is the presence of coeluting matrix compounds that alter the ionization of the target compounds, and which can reduce drastically the response affecting both quantification and detection of pesticide residues. This phenomenon is known as the matrix effect and, because it has an important impact on pesticide analysis, it has been the object of considerable study. There are a number of ways matrix effects can be detected; the most straightforward way is the comparison of the response obtained from a standard solution with that from a standard solution prepared in a matrix extract. This approach can be extended to the comparison of calibration graphs obtained from the analysis of standards prepared in solution with those prepared in matrix extracts. A third approach is the postcolumn infusion system, in which continuous postcolumn infusion of the analyte of interest is performed while blank extracts are injected into the LC column. This enables the evaluation of the absolute matrix effects on the analyte at different portions of the chromatogram, illustrating the need for change in the LC separation required to minimize the matrix effect. If matrix suppression cannot be eliminated by improved sample preparation or reoptimization of LC conditions, careful consideration of calibration strategy is needed to compensate as much as possible for matrix effects. Using matrix-matched calibrants, standard addition or stable isotope-labeled internal standards is recommended.\np78, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

A voltage is applied between the probe tip and the sampling cone. In most instruments, the voltage is applied on the capillary, while the sampling cone is held at low voltage. The capillary, contained within a larger bore tube, allows a concentric nitrogen flow applied to the aerosol at its exit point so that capillary acts as a nebulizer.\nWhile this variant was initially called \u0026ldquo;pneumatically assisted electrospray\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ion spray\u0026rdquo;,this terminology appears to be replaced by the more generic \u0026ldquo;electrospray\u0026rdquo;.\nAerosol droplet formation is enhanced by the added shear forces of the gas and heat transmitted from adjacent supplemental devices, direct heating of the gas itself or with the assistance of an additional heated desolvation gas.\nES ionization takes place as a result of imparting the strong electrical field to the eluent flow as it emerges from the nebulizer, producing an aerosol of charged droplets.\nDue to the solvent evaporation, the size of the droplet reduces, and, consequently, the density of charges at the droplet surface increases. The repulsion forces between the charges increase until there is an explosion of the droplet.\nThese coulombic fissions continue until droplets containing a single analyte ion remain. The charge residue model suggests that a gas-phase ion forms only when solvent from the last droplet evaporates. In the ion evaporation model, the electric field strength at the surface of the droplet is thought to be high enough for solvated ions to attain sufficient charge density to be ejected from the surface of the droplet and transfer directly into the gas phase without evaporation of all the solvent.\nEnsuring that the compound of interest is ionized in solution critical for ES ionization, so mobile phases should have a pH such that the analytes will be ionized.

And we also are very attuned to the fact that you wish to use that solution to its best advantage. We are here, because we want to make sure that the system becomes as approachable and usable as we are as your your partner. It\u0026rsquo;s intrinsically very rewarding for us that after about six years of being in the market with the compact mass spec, we are now rapidly approaching about 1000 units having been sold to academic institutions pharma and biotech, speciality, chemical, and other companies, you are now part of that family. And and we feel that very much, we are here to absolutely support you. So this course is going to be taught by some of our best and brightest scientists and chemists, and even one of our founders are scientific founder. And we intend to have you experience everything from very fundamental to very applied concepts, you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;ll see a lot of sample introduction systems, different integrations, different modalities, and we want you to go back and be able to use the system very, very confidently. So we care about your success more than, than anything, because probably 90% of our sales comes from word of mouth, and testimonial and references. So that\u0026rsquo;s a very key thing for us is is what you experience and how you experience us. So with that, I will turn this over to Dr. Jack Henion. He\u0026rsquo;s our scientific founder, and presently our chief scientific officer, and I hope you have a great next few days. I want to echo that. That point that we really value your being here. And we really want to support your use of the instrument because without you being familiar with it and having a metal mesh with applications that you have, the last thing you want is for sitting on the bench not being used. And so the more you learn and know about it, and how to use it for applications, the more successful you\u0026rsquo;ll be and the more successful we will be. I am an emeritus professor at Cornell University. I\u0026rsquo;ve started as a service laboratory doing mass spectrometry. I did my first LCMS experiment before some of you were born in the fall spring of 1974. It was a crude experiment, but it was the first one I did. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate to be through the entire history of modern LCMS development, the commercial development and so forth. So a fair amount of experience applications in at Cornell were initially of all things racehorse drug testing, so confirming drugs in the urine and blood of a racehorse that evolved into a research program supporting the pharmaceutical industry doing analysis of biological samples by LC MS and LC ms ms. And you name it, I have interfaced it to a mass spectrometry that includes SFC scientific means supercritical fluid chromatography, and that works very nicely on our Abyan system also, I am chromatography, capillary electrophoresis. All these things have been published in the past from our laboratory, my laboratory and others, so a fair amount of experience and doing that.\nMass spectrometry History #  This goes back to 1984, when John Fenn, who shared the Nobel Prize several years ago, reported this. develop this. It actually goes back to 1967, a researcher at in Chicago, who did the very first electrospray, but did not appreciate how powerful it could be. It was John Fenn, who applied it to macromolecules and small molecules. And that was the beginning of a revolution. I was of interest in the mid 80s. That was 1984. In the mid 80s, I followed his work at my research group, and we were quickly sold on this, I like the idea, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t buy it, you had to make it yourself, no big deal. And we did. And I reported it at a ASMS meeting in 1985. I went to that was in June, and in October, I went to another meeting in Germany and an agent at the time of that ASMS meeting, there were four people on the planet, we were one of them doing electrospray.by November, there were 20 people doing it, it just took off nothing took off any faster than the interest in electrospray because John Fenn showed that it could do proteins and in even inorganic polymers.\nIons spray was a patent at Cornell in my laboratory in 1986.

It is much better for nonpolar molecules, steroids, for example, and other kinds of nonpolar molecules.[23:45]\nWe do not see ion current unless it\u0026rsquo;s above this Scan Line. And as you move it up, you can see that you\u0026rsquo;re going to have less than less of this peak, and that\u0026rsquo;s increasing the resolution. The Scan Line determines the resolution.\nGood practice: I trust it, but I take a look at it first thing in the morning, I run something I know the result. You want accurate mass with measurement to the nearest 10th. so checking on our daily or certainly weekly basis. And certainly minimally every month, you should do a mass axis calibration and an auto tune to make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s correctly running.\nAt higher and higher mass, the baseline resolution becomes more challenging.\nWhen ions hit the quadrupole, they are lost, therefore the sensitivity is poor.\nI would go back at the beginning and clean to clean the source, or re tune it to make sure we\u0026rsquo;re getting good ion current performance, rather than kill my multiplier.\ncalibrate and tune mass spectrometer can optimize peak shape.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another way of defining molecular weight that I\u0026rsquo;d like you to forget about because this is not the answer that the mass spectrometer is it\u0026rsquo;s called the relative atomic mass.\nThe low mass region below mass to charge 150 has a lot of chemical noise.\nIf you show me a mass spectrum, I can tell instantly whether you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and are doing a good job of mass spectrometry or haven\u0026rsquo;t tuned your system in a long time, I look for isotopes in the correct ratio.\nIons go in this serpentine path in quadrupole analyzer.\nAPCI technique: liquid was introduced through the capillary to the chamber.

Methanol adducts with itself.\nAdvantage of LC/MS comparing to GC/MS: you can see real molecule.\nTranscripts #  \u0026hellip; let me get started on the first lecture. So understanding atmospheric pressure ionization API can stand for the American Petroleum Institute, or active pharmaceutical ingredient. In this class, it stands for atmospheric pressure ionization. And 30 or 40 years ago, that was unheard of term, we never made ions at atmospheric pressure, we made ions in the vacuum system, if you have any experience with electron ionization, or chemical ionization and GCMS ions are made in inside the vacuum not in the in the atmosphere. So that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s unique about what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. So some of this is pretty basic for someone like yourself, but let\u0026rsquo;s start this all out in the same plane by understanding what a mass spectrum is.\nA mass spectrometer has several components, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about each of them in some detail. We have to make ions in the first place, gaseous ions, and that therefore, we have a source for those ions and ions sources. We have those ions go into the vacuum system after they\u0026rsquo;re formed at atmospheric pressure into the mass analyzer. The ions are detected the at the end the exit of the mass analyzed by a detector, electron multiplier.\nAnd of course, a vacuum is important. Why is the vacuum important in mass spectrometry? if you remember your organic chemistry, ions need to have a mean free path 1, a long mean free path. If we have ions that atmospheric or they run into gas molecules, they run into nitrogen and oxygen, whatever other gases in the system. In a slide going through some of these carnival experiences for kids go through and they hit bags and so forth, it\u0026rsquo;s not a clean path for the (xxxxx, not clear) is a vacuum. So we need to mean free path of several meters, by having a vacuum 10 to the minus six tore (atmospheric pressure being 760 Tore), then we can have a mean free path of several meters on our ions don\u0026rsquo;t hit anything. They can go where we want them to go. So a UV detector does not have to have a vacuum, a gas chromatograph FID detector, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to have a vacuum. But mass spectrometry must have a vacuum for the ions to get where we want them to go.\nAnd so if we have that, we have to vacuum pumps, and we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about each of that. The mass spectrum is shown in the bottom here, it\u0026rsquo;s an XY plot, x is the mass to charge ratio, the mass x and the ordinate or y axis is the percent abundance. So a mass spectrum has a base peak, there should be only one base peak. If you have more than one base peak, you have saturated the detector, and everything\u0026rsquo;s off scale. And by the way, mass spectrometers, including ours are very sensitive. And I am on my favorites comments is the solution to pollution is dilution. We don\u0026rsquo;t inject micrograms of a sample, these things are really sensitive, 50 nanograms of almost anything injected is plenty for ours and other mass spectrometer systems to use.\nOrganic chemists, synthetic chemists make milligrams, sometimes grams of material. And they really need to dilute that reaction mixture dramatically. They must be you must be teaching them from time to time to dilute the samples before they inject.\nAnd so we have a mass spectrum with peaks mass-to-charge ratios, if you will. The most abundant one is called the base peak. And the others are relative to it the relative relative abundance on the ordinate. And so here\u0026rsquo;s a deprotonated line in this example a fragment ion and another fragment ions, and that\u0026rsquo;s a fingerprint for that organic molecule. And so that\u0026rsquo;s the main thing that we often are looking for. With that fingerprint, we can begin to identify or characterize the molecule that we\u0026rsquo;ve just analyzed.\nMolecular Weight information is certainly available from a mass spectrometer. And the question here is why do we combine HPLC with mass spectrometry? The most common thing someone wants a synthetic chemist is the molecular weight. And it\u0026rsquo;s important to note with these atmospheric pressure ionization techniques, we do not get the molecular weight itself directly. we get a protonated molecule, M+H or a deprotonated molecule. I\u0026rsquo;m a little bit of a picky guy nomenclature and so they are not molecular ions, that\u0026rsquo;s what you get in an EI spectrum. They\u0026rsquo;re not protonated molecule ions that\u0026rsquo;s redundant. A protonated molecule chemists knows is an ion basically. So we are getting molecular weight indication via protonated molecule or deprotonated molecule. And as you probably know, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see later, we can have other kinds of adducts, a proton adduct is an adduct, we can have a methanol adduct, we can have an M+32, if we will or M+33. And so solvent ion molecule reactions can occur. Most of the time, it\u0026rsquo;s fairly clean in electrospray, that we have a protonated molecule with another ionization technique that we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about, which has atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, we have fewer adducts. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about that in a later lecture in this session.\nI like to suggest that the mass spectrometer is the truth machine, students used to call it a truth machine. That\u0026rsquo;s why they\u0026rsquo;re so important and forensic applications if you watch certain TV programs. And I was just set a meeting on forensic toxicology, or police work, other kinds of work on drug identification, it\u0026rsquo;s very important to have proof, good selective information that the molecule reporting is not just the retention time. If you do a GC-FID, you have a retention time and you can inject co-elute something and have it be the same retention time, but you can still be fooled. Another molecule may have that same retention time under those conditions, it\u0026rsquo;s very unlikely that another molecule will have the same retention time and the same mass spectrum, because chromatography separates out isobaric molecules, those with the same molecular weight. So it\u0026rsquo;s the ultimate selectivity.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really useful for confirmation of HPLC peak purity, you probably know that UV detectors can now can be diode array. It\u0026rsquo;s a scanning UV spectrum and some people feel that Scot significant or acceptable selectivity. It\u0026rsquo;s better selectivity to just 254 nanometers, but it still is not as good as a mass spectrometer. If you can have a diode array detector in line with a mass spectrometer, nothing wrong with that. That\u0026rsquo;s added selectivity. It\u0026rsquo;s very useful for characterization of isomeric mixtures including chiral mixtures. Mass spectrometry is a chiral. It cannot distinct or differentiate chiral molecules but coupling chromatography with it, HPLC, even GC, you can actually separate enantiomers which are mirror images of each other. And so it\u0026rsquo;s very good for that.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s very important for use of quantitation. Now the original business that I co-founded was a CRO doing LC-MS/MS for the pharmaceutical industry. It\u0026rsquo;s right next door. It\u0026rsquo;s called it used to be called ad Mian but it\u0026rsquo;s been acquired by a company called Quintiles, this time called Q squared solution, there are 65 mass spectrometers over there serving the pharmaceutical industry. And we use stabilized label isotope molecules to do quantitation. Originally, old timers think of mass spectrometry just for qualitative analysis. In the 60s and early 70s. It was used just for identifying things. It can still be used for that. But an awful lot of mass spectrometry has been sold not for qualitative analysis, but quantitative analysis. How much drug in terms of nanograms per ml is in this clinical sample? And so quantitative analysis is really a big business in LC-MS and LC-Ms/Ms. And the part The unique aspect of an isotopically labeled internal standard is it is chemically identical to the D0 or the unlabeled molecule. And it absolutely col-elutes with a molecule but its mass is different. If it\u0026rsquo;s a D3, got three deuterated atoms in it, its masses, three mass units higher in the mass spectrometer can easily distinguished that\u0026rsquo;s a powerful combination, and is revolutionized pharmaceutical analysis. So LCMS with for quantitation is very important. And can be done with our Advion compact mass spectrometer.\nNow if we get into some of the details of our instrument, our instrument looks like this. It\u0026rsquo;s the vertical as opposed to horizontal. Sometimes we wish we\u0026rsquo;d made it flat. So you could stack it like some others do, but it\u0026rsquo;s not. One of the important thing that we are proud of with our system is that we have a very good vacuum system, we have a rough pump and a turbomolecular pump. And as my opening comment said, if you want to do good mass spectrometry, you need a good vacuum. There are some systems on the market without mentioning any names that have tried to be to make it very inexpensive and very small and very light. And they have diaphragm pumps, simple pumps, the kind of thing you\u0026rsquo;ll have in an aquarium, if you will. And those cannot create the vacuum that makes for a good mass spectrometer.\nAnd so here\u0026rsquo;s a cross section of our system. There\u0026rsquo;s the box horizontally inside. we hope to give you a tour later our manufacturing is right nearby. And at some point during your visit here it will show you the insides of these things where they\u0026rsquo;re made right around the corner. And so we have a sprayer we used to say we would spray and pray that would work that was in the 70s and 80s. And we did spray and pray that it would work. Now we don\u0026rsquo;t have to pray at least on this anymore, we spray and we know how to spray and make it make a good series of ions.\nSo we have a sprayer in all of LCMS you\u0026rsquo;ve got a liquid and we need to make tiny droplets. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about that. So this is an atmospheric pressure, we have ions that are sampled into this capillary into this region. And we have a pumping system for that region, they go through the ions makeup turn, it\u0026rsquo;s really helpful to have ions have a nonlinear path. Ions are I like to say somewhat like teenagers, you can sort of guide them, you keep them out of trouble, if you will. And so ions we can make to make the turn but neutral molecules of which there are a lot that are not affected by the electric fields and they can be pumped away. So it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have ions make a turn of some sort. And most commercial systems on the market today have some form of an ion path that\u0026rsquo;s nonlinear basically. And so we spray we have a sub ambient region here and as we go further along this path, we have higher and higher vacuum, if you will. So the sample introduction can be done by HPLC, by infusion, by flow injection analysis, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about each of these, the ion source make science either by electrospray atmospheric pressure, chemical ionization, or another approach that we call ASAP that we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about a simple technique that it does not use HPLC as an inlet system. By the way, there are almost there\u0026rsquo;s approaching 30 different ways of making ions that what the vast majority are by electrospray or APCI. The others are more esoteric and developing. The mass analysis designed by a quadrupole. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about that. That\u0026rsquo;s this section right in here. And the detector is an electron multiplier at the end of the ion path. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about each of these components in a little detail in sequence. I like to be very analytical. My wife says I\u0026rsquo;m anal. I say no, I\u0026rsquo;m analytical and take this in a very systematic way.\nSo this is a slow video of of our system. If I click on an issue start to see the spray come down through the capillary, the voltages are shown here, the droplets are evaporated, and electrostatically focused in the capillary. And they make the turn here, neutrals being pumped away by the vacuum pump. Here are the pressures or vacuum in these areas regions, they continue through this, this ion optics to the quadrupole mass analyzer. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about these more in a bit. But the only selected or filtered ions are passed through the detector, and they go to the detector and that gives us our mass spectrum. It gives us an ion chromatograph profile. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing LC that\u0026rsquo;s called a chromatogram. And ion chromatogram. Some people call things chromatograms. When there was no LC, again, I\u0026rsquo;m picky. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to call it a chromatogram. If there was no chromatography, there is another term some people use a [xxx], I\u0026rsquo;m not sure where that came from. But in any case, we get ion current profile. sample coming off and going away in the mass spectrum or the fingerprint.\nSo the next slide shows the details of that, if you will. With respect to the various voltages, when you go in the laboratory, I hope that you can think like a mass, I think like a lot like an ion. And by the way, I have an insight edge on this, if you take note of my last name, a student well into my career pointed out to me that I have ion in my last name, no wonder I like this field, I guess. So a Henion doesn\u0026rsquo;t really exist. But it launches, I want you to think like an ion and, what would it be like to go through here and be in see the detector, again, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about each of these components in sequence.\nSo the vacuum system very important to have a good backup system, our system can be put on a cart, there is a stackable part, whether it\u0026rsquo;s an entire LCMS system on the cart, and on the bottom is this vacuum pump. And people don\u0026rsquo;t like this vacuum pump. Because it\u0026rsquo;s heavy, it makes a little bit of noise, it\u0026rsquo;s a really good vacuum pump, it\u0026rsquo;s a rough pump. vacuum is created by two stages of pumping. The first stage is a rough pump or rotary pump. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about this one. And that pumps the vacuum down to 10 to minus 2, 10 to minus three tour. But we need a better vacuum than that. That\u0026rsquo;s where the turbo molecular pump comes in, that we will talk about in more detail in a bit. The two pumps together make a very good vacuum system. And our system really is well pump. So the rubbery pump or rub pump is that one on the bottom is connected by a hose to the inlet or to a whole pipe on the back of the or mass spectrometer. And the turbo molecular pumps are shown here. This is a unique one with differential pumping across it. And these are old rings that bolt up underneath, you never have to worry about this part, these are very reliable. They\u0026rsquo;re also very expensive, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to buy one of these. But this is the heart of the system that creates the high vacuum, there\u0026rsquo;s creates a ultra clean vacuum system and the regulation and maintenance of the vacuum is all done by the by the system. So here is again, a cross section of our mass spectrometer the mass analyzer region, this is what the component the whole component looks like when it\u0026rsquo;s out of the system. What I want to point out here is that we have three regions of evacuation, there is the first region there\u0026rsquo;s the second region and there\u0026rsquo;s the third region. this one turbo pump pumps all three of those regions. This is called the boost stage, the drag stage and the turbo like molecular pump, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know or worry about that. But it\u0026rsquo;s useful to know that one pump is doing a really nice job of pumping this whole analyzer region. And that\u0026rsquo;s a little unusual, other commercial systems in the past have had two or three different turbo molecular pumps, each one dedicated this region one dedicated to this region and so forth that adds the cost that adds the complexity and we cannot take too much credit other than being smart enough to choose this because this is a commercially available pump that can be that others use and we have chosen to use for this system. So we spray into this capillary make ions and that atmospheric pressure in the pumping system maintains 10 to minus six tors, or there abouts. Ionization we need to make ions, all mass spectrometry makes a gas phase ion. If we make the ion at atmospheric pressure, we\u0026rsquo;ve got to somehow get it into the vacuum system and into the mass analyzer. Historically, electron ionization used to be called something called electron impact, but it was never really an impact. But the correct term is electron ionization that\u0026rsquo;s still in vogue. It\u0026rsquo;s still very popular for GCMs gas chromatography mass spectrometry. You can also do ChemiCal ionization inside of a for GCMs. And we\u0026rsquo;re not doing either of those. There\u0026rsquo;s also atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and we and others can do that for LCMS. There are other the all those ions are under the gas phase incorporated into a gas phase.\nOther techniques in involve invoke what\u0026rsquo;s called desorption ionization. And there are a variety of them. Some of them are shown down here. But electrospray is essentially a desorbing. The ion is formed in a droplet, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to see the droplet gets smaller and smaller and smaller. But at some point, the ion is desorbed from that droplet, it\u0026rsquo;s called I like this term, it\u0026rsquo;s called ion evaporation, it literally evaporates from the droplet into the mass spectrometer, and that\u0026rsquo;s the heart of electrospray as we\u0026rsquo;ll see. The other techniques that I\u0026rsquo;ve shown in screen that we use on our system available to you is this atmospheric solids analysis probe. This is a simple way of introducing a sample it does not involve LCMS in any way. It says probe that you put your sample on, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see this operate in the laboratory. And of course, we have vapor atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, or vAPCI, see, as we call it, which you\u0026rsquo;ll learn about too. other techniques are commercially available. I might add that these FAB Fast Atom Bombardment used to be a detergent, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it still exists. But these are no longer commercially available. These were brought out in the late 70s 80s and have come and gone basically, they\u0026rsquo;ve been put out of business by newer, better ionization techniques. MALDI matrix assisted laser absorption is alive as well, that\u0026rsquo;s still a very popular technique, we do not provide MALDI for our system. And these other techniques, Atmospheric Pressure Photo Ionization, DART, DESI, and this etc, includes another 25 Different ionization means of doing that. But the most popular across the board are electrospray and APCI techniques. Slide: The Ion Source #  [21:41] So the ion source, how do we make ions? We have two major ways I\u0026rsquo;ve just mentioned electrospray, I have also mentioned APCI. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at electrospray. This is a very narrow or capillary, think of a syringe needle, maybe a 10 microliters syringe needle, and let\u0026rsquo;s convert that into what we call a sprayer, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have liquid going through it, pumped by either an infusion pump or an LC pump. So the inside diameter is very small, probably 100 microns, what\u0026rsquo;s the diameter of a human hair 80 microns. So this capillary, this needle is very small inside diameter, liquids going through it, and we're going to put high voltage on it. This goes back to 1984, when John Fenn, who shared the Nobel Prize several years ago, reported this. develop this. It actually goes back to 1967, a researcher at in Chicago, who did the very first electrospray, but did not appreciate how powerful it could be. It was John Fenn, who applied it to macromolecules and small molecules. And that was the beginning of a revolution. I was of interest in the mid 80s. That was 1984. In the mid 80s, I followed his work at my research group, and we were quickly sold on this, I like the idea, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t buy it, you had to make it yourself, no big deal. And we did. And I reported it at a ASMS meeting in 1985. I went to that was in June, and in October, I went to another meeting in Germany and an agent at the time of that ASMS meeting, there were four people on the planet, we were one of them doing electrospray. By November, there were 20 people doing it, it just took off nothing took off any faster than the interest in electrospray because John Fenn showed that it could do proteins and in even inorganic polymers.\nSo electrospray makes these droplets, ions are in the droplets, in solution if you will. And it undergoes the ion evaporation model 2, which we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about more right in the region of this inlet to the mass spectrometer. ions are formed that go into there in our mass analyzer. The alternative technique of atmospheric pressure Chemical Ionization is also a useful technique for certain molecules. This one is most useful for very polar molecules, and macromolecules, peptides and proteins and unlike those have nitrogens. They are can be protonated. They\u0026rsquo;re easily to form them in an aqueous solution. This technique is not amenable. APCI is not good for proteins or inorganic or large molecules. It is much better for nonpolar molecules, steroids, for example, and other kinds of nonpolar molecules [not clean about this part].\nAnd unfortunately, in my view, this is not used anywhere near as much as it could. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how often you use it in your training with your students. I would suggest it should not be forgotten. The vast majority people use only electrospray evens under some conditions or doesn\u0026rsquo;t work that well and APCI would work better. Think of it as a tool in your toolbox. A mechanic or a plumber takes out the optimum tool for whatever they\u0026rsquo;re doing. There may be times when you\u0026rsquo;re struggling having electrospray work when APCI might work better. The unique difference between electrospray and APCI is we have this discharge needle, call it a spark plug, it\u0026rsquo;s a needle with high voltage three or 4000 volts. It creates literally a spark and that\u0026rsquo;s positioned in the plume, the vapor that\u0026rsquo;s coming through this system. there is no such needle - discharge needle in electrospray. The ions are formed by applying voltage to this capillary itself, they aren\u0026rsquo;t the voltage is applied to this needle in this case, and these plume has gas phase molecules in it. And they are ionized by gas phase chemistry. So, this is in solution chemistry, this is gas phase chemistry a big difference between the two. If gas phase chemistry is required for APCI, you can sort of understand why myoglobin [a protein] will not work well by APCI. It\u0026rsquo;s 9,000, like your wages doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a vapor pressure, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to do a protein with APCI. So, these are both useful tools, you may have purchased only one or the other, or you may have purchased both, it\u0026rsquo;s up to your applications. So, that\u0026rsquo;s an intro to these two major ion sources that are available.\nTypes of mass spectrometers #  Types of mass spectrometers, ours is a single quadrupole mass spectrometer. there are triple quadruples, and by the way, the more the Q\u0026rsquo;s you have, the more the price goes up. So instead of 50, 60, $70,000, they can be $500,000. If you want to get an orbittrap down here, it can take me three quarters of a million dollars. These get much more expensive, easily over $500,000. But these are powerful analytical tools. And in the CRO next door, I think we had four orbitraps and some ToF. Another instrument that\u0026rsquo;s used to be more popular than it is now at the moment, there\u0026rsquo;s only one vendor that sells FT-ICR Fourier Transform mass spectrometry. That\u0026rsquo;s Bruker. It used to be the thermo had one, but they came thermo came up with the orbitTrap. It is so powerful that they stopped analytically powerful that they no longer sell a FTMS. So these are other kinds of mass analyzes. The system you have from us is a single quadrupole.\nThe Quadrupole Mass Analyzer #  So the quadrupole mass analyzer, if you break the vacuum, shut the pumps off and vent the system, this sometimes needs to be done, you look inside, you can see the quadrupole assembly as shown here. So this familiar schematic shown here, the ion source, the ion optics in the beginning and the quadrupole, we are looking at this region right here. And at the end exit of the quadrupole is the electron multiplier detector. Ions go through the quadrupole. I initially naively thought ions went through like a laser, just like a light beam, they don\u0026rsquo;t. they go with us in the three dimensional Serpentine, if you will. path is shown here. There\u0026rsquo;s a software called SIMION. It reproduces the paths of ions with computers. And it shows that these ions go in this serpentine path. Our goal, your goal is to have make sure the ions don\u0026rsquo;t hit the surface of the rod, because then they\u0026rsquo;re lost. So mass resolution ion optics is keeping the ions going through the center of the quadrupole and resolving them. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about that later.\nSo the ions go through under different conditions under different conditions with different RF, radio frequency DC voltages, and adjacent ions are resolved. So they all get to the detector at different times. And that composite view is a mass spectrum of all those ions. The Stability Diagram #  Note: It is about the Scan Line.\n[28:19] So this is a little bit technical, but I always found this very helpful. You have auto tune, and you can go in and manually tune the system. And I would encourage you to learn a little bit more beyond auto tune so you can appreciate what\u0026rsquo;s going on. In the properly adjusted mass axis, you we see ions that are above this red line, this is called a Scan Line. It\u0026rsquo;s a constant DC RF voltage applied by the system. And we do not see ion current unless it\u0026rsquo;s above this red line, this red line can be displaced upwards at the same slope. And as you move it up, you can see that you\u0026rsquo;re going to have less than less of this peak. And that\u0026rsquo;s increasing the resolution, we increase the resolution as we raise this Scan Line. And we can raise it or lower it with a constant slope. Or we can alternately hold this origin the same and just rotate this up or down. And you can see that that would affect the high mass end, this is the high mass end if you will, the more than the low mass end and so autotune does all that. And if you really get good at this and and want to optimize your system, some customers like to go in and manually do it and you can do that. So the Scan Line determines the resolution.\nThis is an example of good resolution 353.23 And that\u0026rsquo;s 350.3. So they are they are baseline resolved or maybe 5 or 10% generally resolved. That\u0026rsquo;s at the low end, it\u0026rsquo;s easier for a quadrupole to have unit mass resolution. That\u0026rsquo;s what set is called as unit mass resolution at the low end. Our quadrupole goes to 2000 mass units, and others do too. And any quadrupole has more of a challenge they can do it, but maintaining good resolution high mass at the upper end is more challenging. And so here is an example of poor resolution, not from our system, just as for didactic purposes are three ions in there, and they\u0026rsquo;re not resolved, you would have to increase the slope of this Scan Line. And if you did, you could then resolve those ions. So that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re doing when you\u0026rsquo;re increasing the resolution, the mass resolution, I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about chromatographic resolution, is sort of analogous, but it\u0026rsquo;s mass resolution, and auto tune and you are in or your own hands. If you have peaks that are not hopefully this bad off, but maybe you see a shoulder they\u0026rsquo;re barely resolved, you\u0026rsquo;re going to improve that by increasing the slope of this line. And that\u0026rsquo;s called the stability diagram.\nThe CMS (Compact Mass Spectrometer) adjusts the RF/DC ratio as the mass increases to maintain unit mass resolution across the mass range. The quadrupole must be calibrated using known mass standards. We infuse or inject a known mixture of compounds where we know the masses and we calibrate the mass axis and the resolution based upon that compound. And then when you run unknowns, you can be confident you will get the correct mass. Do you have a Mettler balance in your laboratory, Fisher balance and Accurate balance? If you\u0026rsquo;re, if you\u0026rsquo;re well run managed laboratory you probably have that someone come in every six months or so to calibrate that. you don\u0026rsquo;t just use a mass Mettler balance for 10 years straight without over a mass of adjusting it. And so a mass spectrometer is similar in that needs to be calibrated. Mass access calibration adjusted on an ongoing basis. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to do it every day. I\u0026rsquo;m really picky. And I really want to be confident I trust but verify. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t Reagan that made that popular. I trust it. But I take a look at it first thing in the morning, I run something I know the result. And I make sure those masses are correct. And that\u0026rsquo;s not shift, the mass axis isn\u0026rsquo;t shifting. If you have a really bad day, or you never haven\u0026rsquo;t adjusted our resolution in months, it\u0026rsquo;s possible for it to drift instead of being 302.3. It could be 302.6, or eight or even worst case, a mass unit off, you want accurate mass with measurement to the nearest 10th. And so checking on our daily or certainly weekly basis. And certainly minimally every month, you should do a mass axis calibration and an auto tune to make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s correctly running. Don\u0026rsquo;t just trust it like a UV detector, the only thing you have to worry about UV detector is the light going out. And you will know because you\u0026rsquo;ll see nothing. On this one, it takes a little more attention to make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s behaving itself.\nSlide #  [32:48] So here\u0026rsquo;s what we typically show for Windows, these are zooming in on certain regions. This is the wiring diagram or schematic for, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about this taking care of running in the quadruples, by the way the quadruples are about that long, I think you\u0026rsquo;ll see some they\u0026rsquo;re about as big as that a little thicker. They\u0026rsquo;re highly precisely made. We don\u0026rsquo;t make them, very few people make them. It takes real skill to do that. They are must be absolutely accurately arrayed. It\u0026rsquo;s a quadrupolar array for them. And they are not just stuck together with glue. They\u0026rsquo;re very, very precisely made. And so here\u0026rsquo;s a mass range, this is 74. Going out the 52. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to see this 1034 Think out here. And you can see this is 74. This is 75 well resolved masses. This is 200 and something in the one the next mass you know, so you want to see pictorially like this that the adjacent masses differing by one are easily resolved. They don\u0026rsquo;t have to be widely resolved. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to drive cars between them. But you want to have them baseline resolved as shown here. And as you can see at higher and higher mass, the baseline resolution becomes more challenging, but this is perfectly adequate for typical for most applications.\nSlide: Cartoon #  Here\u0026rsquo;s a cartoon or a video showing how ions go through the mass analyzer. Notice they don\u0026rsquo;t go through like a straight line. If they are lost, if they aren\u0026rsquo;t focused correctly, they\u0026rsquo;ll be lost and that means you have poor sensitivity, you means you haven\u0026rsquo;t not resolved the mass resolution well enough to have it. Get the ions into the detector.\nSlide: Mass Spectrometer Components - Detector #  The other mass mass mass spectrometer components the one most importantly are very important at the end exit of the mass exit at the exit of the quadrupole is a electron multiplier detector. I like that term because it is a multiplier. It has a gain of million. 10 to the six. that means that one ion hits the surface, here comes an ion into the surface, And that produces an electron, remember it\u0026rsquo;s an electron multiplier. This does not measure directly ions, it creates a beam of electrons. So one ion hits the surface, and makes the electron come off. I will have a cartoon later, a movie showing that. that hits the surface and two electrons come off, those two ions sit here and it cascades. And that happens a million times very, very quickly. So the ion current through the quadrupole is infinitesimally small weak, it must be amplified by a million to actually see our signal. So there\u0026rsquo;s not lots of ions going through at one time on the quadripolar, there are a few and we amplify that in any mass spectrometer, operates in the same way. So very weak ion current exiting the quadrupole. But that gets amplified through this approach by electron multiplier.\nSlide: Cartoon of Electron Multiplier Operation #  So here\u0026rsquo;s a cartoon of that. this is kind of slow, but it shows an ion coming in to hit this surface. It happens much faster than that. now there\u0026rsquo;s an electron coming off, they hit that surface, that comes down here, creates two electrons. And that continues on and on, amplifying it, happening very very fast. We can [xxx] 1000 1000 1000s of Dalton\u0026rsquo;s per second, and this can keep up with it. And so that\u0026rsquo;s the electron multiplier at the end of the exit. This does not last forever. This is a consumable, you need to appreciate that once in a while, maybe once a year, if you have take good care of it, and don\u0026rsquo;t run it at too high of voltage. In my last two years or more, some people start to see deterioration of performance, poor sensitivity. And so they jack up the voltage on the multiplier, that hurts it, that\u0026rsquo;ll give you more sensitivity, but I would go back at the beginning and clean to clean the source, or retune it to make sure we\u0026rsquo;re getting good ion current performance, rather than kill my multiplier. So just a point in noting that the multiplier is something that from time to time, you must purchase a new one and have it installed. And either do that yourself or hire that done by someone who is used to doing that.\nSlide: calibrating and tuning the mass spectrometer #  calibrating and tuning the mass spectrometer, something we don\u0026rsquo;t have to do with an FID detector or UV, it\u0026rsquo;s very important to calibrate in tune that\u0026rsquo;s tuning the ion and optics adjusting it for optimum sensitivity to ensure that the mass accuracy the resolution, and the peak symmetry and intensity are all within instrumental specifications, it can get off its feet, it can start to look poor as a result of not doing a recent tune. it can go weeks and weeks without doing it but you cannot go forever without doing it. A mass calibration is performed to adjust the measured mass to charge ratio to match the reference mass-to-charge with a with a allowable tolerance of $\\pm$ 0.1. So we do not have accurate mass measurement accurate mass measurement, you need an orbit trap or a time of flight to have 0.1562 really an accurate mass, but we can readily provide $\\pm$ 0.1 mass units we and other quadruples. autotune is performed with just the measured mass resolution and full width of half max is this term to be within allowable limits and the universe resolution at half width halfway up the peak 0.5 - 0.7 m/z (m over z) unit says generally defined as unit mass resolution those adjacent masses will be near baseline resolved as well to optimize the peak shape. They the ions when I say peak here, it\u0026rsquo;s ion peaks not chromatographic peace and intensity of the caliber and peaks Caliburn peaks are the reference compound that we\u0026rsquo;re using. There\u0026rsquo;s two vials one for positive ion, one for negative ion and you infuse those in, it\u0026rsquo;s a mixture of chemicals and we you know, the masses in the system can be calibrated based upon those, it\u0026rsquo;s critical that the system is calibrated in tune to encompass the analytes mass to charge ratio that is an analyte m over z must lie within a calibration mass range for mass spectral accuracy.\nSlide: Resolution Calculation #  So here is full width of half mass these are two adjacent masses, these are not chromatograms. This is a mass to charge ratio. And at full full width at half max. If that is 0.5 - 0.7 Dalton\u0026rsquo;s as defined as unit mass resolution. That\u0026rsquo;s the kind of performance you should get. resolution as long been defined as m over delta m - the mass the actual mass divided by that delta mass. And that\u0026rsquo;s the resolution. How we define and others define mass resolution in a mass spectrometer.\nSlide: Interpretation of Mass spectra Caffeine #  So let\u0026rsquo;s take good old caffeine, there is this elemental composition C8H10. High resolution is needed to accurately get that in elemental composition. There are some software and other ways of doing that. But in general, call it single quadrupole does not give us that but it does give us the molecular weight. So the nominal mass so this molecule is eight times 12, eight, eight times carbon, 10 times hydrogen. It\u0026rsquo;s nominal mass, not as accurate mass, but its nominal basis four this for nitrogen, so four times 14 and so forth. That adds up to 194 molecular weight. There\u0026rsquo;s another way of defining molecular weight that I\u0026rsquo;d like you to forget about because this is not the answer that the mass spectrometer is it\u0026rsquo;s called the relative atomic mass. And I was horrified when I first learned that the Merck index, you can look at the Merck index, which has a list of lots of drugs by molecular weight, and they have list them listed in there as relative atomic masses. This is before the Merck goes way back to the 1800s. This is befor mass spectrometry. And I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people going into pharmaceuticals few years ago, and they would have a Merck compound and they would, they would adjust their mass spectrometer to get the answer that Merck index had rather than what how God made the molecule. And so the what you really want is what\u0026rsquo;s shown here, the Monoisotopic exact mass. So this is the accurate mass hydrogen is 1.0078. Roughly point one, what what this is, is the isotope weighted mass, so a weights the percentage of carbon 13, the weight of them weights, the mass of carbon 15, these are small amounts that shifts the mass higher, generally those masses are higher in mass, that\u0026rsquo;s 0.09, the real answer is 0.08, are you really bothered by that, perhaps not. But a higher molecular weight molecule, when you get the four, and five, and 800, that becomes much more different. And so the monoisotopic get exact mass is what you should be adding up. And that\u0026rsquo;s what your mass spectrometer when properly tuned and calibrated will give you.\nSlide #  [41:28] So here\u0026rsquo;s a mono.., this is mass-to-charge. Looks like a chromatogram. But as always pay attention to the x axis, here is your molecule, there is the 195.1. If we go back one, if you round this up to the nearest 10th, so 194.1, and you add a proton, and you have 195.1, it\u0026rsquo;s not off by one, that\u0026rsquo;s because we\u0026rsquo;ve added a proton. That\u0026rsquo;s how we form an ion for caffeine. Importantly, what really brought electrospray on board was its ability to do large molecules. And so here is a one mass unit apart from these ions, this is a fairly high molecular weight here is 1340, 1349, or 48, that\u0026rsquo;s 48, 49, 50. These, the distance between these, which is something you should pay attention to is one mass unit. What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between these two, this is a doubly charged peptide, the difference here is a half a mass unit. So m over z is simple arithmetic, the mass of protonate, a molecule divided by one gives you this spacing here, if you divide by two, you get half of that. And so the spacing between ions is a signpost for whether it\u0026rsquo;s a doubly or triply charged ion. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to distinguish beyond that by looking at the mass spectrum, there\u0026rsquo;s software that can do that. But be aware that if you have a doubly charged ion, that means a peptide has two protons on it rather than just one. Some peptide is going to have three protons. a protein 150 kilodaltons can have hundreds of protein of protons on it. And so they\u0026rsquo;re multiple charged ions with these are called. any of you looking at peptides and proteins, it\u0026rsquo;s certainly capable of doing that. small molecules, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about this.\nSlide #  A representative API mass mass spectra, assured molecular weight, as long as you can do earth or arithmetic, the molecular weight is not this peak, it\u0026rsquo;s one less than that, because that\u0026rsquo;s M+H. So I facetiously say you need to know how to subtract or add one one. If you have some fragmentation occurring, then you can have product ions or fragment ions. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about that. This is not MSMS we\u0026rsquo;ll show you how that if you have some in source fragmentation called spread to the fragment or bolded. Some companies call it that we can take this mild ionization, electrospray and APCI is very mild ionization, the ionization itself does not cause fragmentation. It\u0026rsquo;s very gentle, unlike electron ionization, which is 70 electron volts and lots of energy. But we can increase the energy of an ion and cause or produce fragmentation to get more information.\nSlide #  Positive ion LCMS, some examples, here\u0026rsquo;s malathion. That\u0026rsquo;s the chromatogram coming out in a little over five minutes. If we put the cursor on that peak, we can get its mass spectrum. Here\u0026rsquo;s the mass spectrum always pay attention to the axis as as m over z. This is time. And so we can look at the mass spectrum of any peak, there\u0026rsquo;s only one here. This is the protonated molecule. Here\u0026rsquo;s a fragment ion. And if you\u0026rsquo;re one thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask is how many of you have a basic understanding of organic chemistry, Garden Wright organic chemistry, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about molecules that are organic molecules, you all have a comfortable feeling good. That\u0026rsquo;s really helpful to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on here because we like to speculate or postulate what this ion might be in this isn\u0026rsquo;t a toxic group. And if you protonate that you can lose ethanol. And that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s a good a plausible explanation for why we\u0026rsquo;re seeing this product. I\u0026rsquo;m here that makes perfect sensor that could happen that would be a stable oxonian[??] ion. So that\u0026rsquo;s that example.\nSlide: Comparison between Full-Scan API and API SIM #  comparison between full scan, atmospheric pressure ionization and selected ion monitoring, a lot of people call this single ion. If you\u0026rsquo;re only monitoring one, I can agree that sing single line, but the correct term is selected ion monitoring. And so here\u0026rsquo;s our information on our software, we have clicked, we\u0026rsquo;ve got a 20 minute run we\u0026rsquo;ve we\u0026rsquo;ve told it to do to scan the scan range, which is from 100 to 700. And we\u0026rsquo;re doing that this scan rate. And when we do that, we get this mass spectrum, we get these ions that are that are labeled, if we instead want to do selected iron monitoring, which is targeted analysis, that was you\u0026rsquo;ll see later that that can be used for quantitation, Or for improved sensitivity, we can ask the mass spectrometer or tell it using SIM, we click this button instead of this one, you\u0026rsquo;ll see this in the lab. And we can select 609, 472 and 311 that we\u0026rsquo;re going to monitor and we see this abbreviated mass spectrum, that\u0026rsquo;s SIM acquisition. So those are two very important acquisition profiles that you can use.\nSlide: Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM) #  Selected ion monitoring monitors only selected ions from the full scan mass spectrum. So you have to know what the mass spectrum is first, right? You cannot do this on a total unknown molecule because you don\u0026rsquo;t know what the ions are going to be. You can speculate but you may be wrong. This technique does not scan the mass spectrometer but rapidly jumps from selected ion to selected ion jumps through that space. It\u0026rsquo;s used again added sensitivity and selectivity over a full scan mass spectrum. It has been said that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be it can be up to 100 times more sensitive than full scan. So if you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble seeing something on their full scan opposition get a little bit LC peak. If you\u0026rsquo;d switch to SU and selected ion monitoring reinject select the ions of interest, you\u0026rsquo;ll see great big nice pretty LC peak, when you couldn\u0026rsquo;t see very well before. It\u0026rsquo;s a dramatic improvement in sensitivity and selectivity.\nIt is used for targeted analysis, select an ion a minor thing means you have to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for and what those ions are.\nIn the favorite applications where this is used, certainly for quantitative analysis with a single mass analyzer system. And by the way, if you have a stable isotope internal standard, but D3, or six C13 is an aromatic ring. This is a golden way of doing quantitative analysis that the system can be done a selected ion monitoring, and you\u0026rsquo;ll alternately monitor the D0 versus a D3 or there\u0026rsquo;s the C12 versus a C13 isotopes.\nincrease sensitivity and reduce interference from chemical noise, the signal to noise ratio will be different. One elephant in the room dirty little secret we have, we\u0026rsquo;re doing LCMS. And what\u0026rsquo;s in the mobile phase, water, acetonitrile, methanol, maybe some additives like formic acid, the low mass region below mass to charge 150 has a lot of chemical noise, ethanol methanol adducting with itself. The good news is if we want to look at a real molecule a molecule we might better you do GCMS, we LCMS for intractable molecules that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to make derivatives of that, that are higher mass. And so in generally, when you scan full scan, you do not scan down to mass-to-charge 20, huge chemical noise, we usually scan, hope assuming our molecule, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to see something below 150, I like to use 150 as the low end, I think the example I just showed you was mass-to-charge 200, 200 to 700, or something like that. The reason we don\u0026rsquo;t scan full scan is because there\u0026rsquo;s chemical noise down there in an in trying to see the command LC chromatogram for a molecule that will be underneath the chemical noise. Take that one step further and do selected ion monitoring. Now you\u0026rsquo;ve got like to say blinders on the mass spectrometer, you\u0026rsquo;re not looking at chemical noise at all, it\u0026rsquo;s there, but you\u0026rsquo;re only looking at the signal of interest, and your signal to noise will be dramatically improved. Which sensitivity one definition is signal to noise.\nSlide #  Here\u0026rsquo;s some practical examples of Enlite herbicides is a DuPont herbicide, they\u0026rsquo;re using soybeans. And here\u0026rsquo;s a mixture of three of them. And you click on or touch the cursor on that peak. And you get that mass spectrum with the isotopes nicely shown. And if you show me a mass spectrum, like I\u0026rsquo;m showing here, I can tell instantly whether you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and are doing a good job of mass spectrometry or haven\u0026rsquo;t tuned your system in a long time, I look for isotopes in the correct ratio, I don\u0026rsquo;t want this eight plus one to be half of that or higher than that that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s representative of how many carbon 13 are in there, which is only 1.1% for each carbon. And so for each of these LC peaks we get a fingerprint of these molecules. This one happens to have looks like it has some chlorine in it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quick glance I can see a three to one ratio with the chlorine isotope.\nIf that was full scan, if I now go positive ions selected ion monitoring, I see the the total selected ion that\u0026rsquo;s what this is a total Select ion current, here is this molecule. And we have two of them with the same same mass and we\u0026rsquo;ve got one that\u0026rsquo;s called eluding and we got one that\u0026rsquo;s separated here. So selected ion monitoring on this would be for I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you a soil extract. If you want to look for pesticides, herbicides in soil, then you would you select an ion monitoring, and that looks like this. So here\u0026rsquo;s a farmer spraying his soybeans in the field before he plants it. And here are these drugs are compounds herbicides from the soil. And you can readily use this technology for that.\nSlide: Summary of Full-Scan \u0026amp; SIM Features #  So a farmer a summary of full scan versus SIM features,\nAPI LCMS analysis will provide molecular weight information by means of a protonated molecule for separated components, and very little fragmentation unless you increase the source in source CID.\nAPI, atmospheric pressure ionization chemical noise will limit detection limits, and identification of fragment ions, especially at the low mass end. one example that I\u0026rsquo;ve had experience with is amphetamine, molecular weight 135. That\u0026rsquo;s done on the chemical noise, or you have solvent adducts and so forth. And so to go to really low level levels of amphetamine, it can be difficult unless you do select ion monitoring, then the chemical noises goes down by [xxx] because you\u0026rsquo;re not monitoring it. SIM has lower better detection limits in full scan mode by at least 10 to 5, 10 to 50 and often 100. Those examples in literature, special examples of 1000 fold increase, how would you like to have your salary increased 1000 fold and you go back next week, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here. even with me here you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. So that\u0026rsquo;s a big gain in sensitivity and that\u0026rsquo;s not average, but 100 fold you might take that on your salary too. I like to put things in perspective so you can really relate to it.\nSIM will provide the best sensitivity prophets preferred over full scan for quantitative analysis. You can do quantitation by full scan by full scan, but it\u0026rsquo;s not worth doing. It\u0026rsquo;s SMS works much better. For requires analysts knows what the analyte it is. you\u0026rsquo;re doing targeted analysis, you suspect certain compounds, as you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. analyzer does not scan, the mass spectrometer jumped from one selected mass-to-charge value to the other.\nAnd at the end now we have a lot of references as a lot of information, basic information for your reference that relate to the kinds of things I\u0026rsquo;ve just been discussing. So that brings us to the end of lecture one.\n  The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a moving molecule between collisions.\nIntroduction\nImagine gas leaking out of a pipe. It would take a while for the gas to diffuse and spread into the environment. This is because gas molecules collide with each other, causing them to change in speed and direction. Therefore, they can never move in a straight path without interruptions. Between every two consecutive collisions, a gas molecule travels a straight path. The average distance of all the paths of a molecule is the mean free path. Analogy\nImagine a ball traveling in a box ; the ball represents a moving molecule. Every time the ball hits a wall, a collision occurs and the direction of the ball changes (Figure 1). The ball hits the wall five times, causing five collisions. Between every two consecutive collisions, the ball travels an individual path. It travels a total of four paths between the five collisions; each path has a specific distance, d. The mean free path, $\\lambda$, of this ball is the average length of all four paths. \nSource: mean free path\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n this is one of two models.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n  "},{"id":130,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Advion-Courses/Lecture-02/","title":"Lecture 2 - FIA, ESI \u0026 APCI","section":"Advion Courses on LC-MS","content":"so an HPLC, we typically had a few 1000 plates, which is not much, UHPLC has dramatically improved that, it\u0026rsquo;s still not as good as capillary GC.\nFlow injection analysis: particle-free is important to prevent form plug up at the ESI.\nyou have a particle stuck in your tube, and the sprayer has high voltage on it, the liquids coming through at 200 microliters per minute, and it\u0026rsquo;s possible to get a particle stuck in there.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have good sensitivity if we have large droplets.\nAnd so the other thing you may not appreciate is the negative ion mode, the chemical background that gets in our way of the positive ion, there are many fewer molecules in the background of our systems that respond to negative ions. So the chemical noise goes down, because it does not get deprotonated. So I will lean towards negative ion detection, if I\u0026rsquo;m after sensitivity.\nIf you want to optimize your chances of getting rid of any carryover, certain solvent Like isopropanol, as opposed to methanol, some of the heavier alcohols are better solvents and a solid blank to displace them more than you want to know.\nyou need to be aware of the relative ratios of the heat and the nebulizing gas and nitrogen nebulizing gas.\nelectrospray is a concentration sensitive detector\nSo the lower the flow, the smaller the peak volume in the LC peak, the more sensitivity we\u0026rsquo;ll have.\nif you lower the voltage, what do we call global electrospray this may produce improved sensitivity\nslower is better within the region of 200 microliters per minute higher can be accommodated but ion current stability can be deteriorated as well as sensitivity.

A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t remember it, don\u0026rsquo;t use it. But it can be very helpful in optimizing results. If you maintain the pH and the preferred region based on what your compound needs.\nIf we\u0026rsquo;re trying to evaporate droplets that make sense, we want as low boiling mixture as possible. So we ideal spray has low boiling point, a low dielectric constant and a low surface tension.\ndoing nano electrospray or micro LC gives you sensitivity.\nions do like do not like being in hexane, alcohols or trace aqueous may be produced.\nIdeal electrospray solvent has low boiling point, a low dielectric constant and a low surface tension.\nA combination of heat and nebulizing gas and time to get droplets from the sprayer where they\u0026rsquo;re fairly large down to the point where we have ion evaporation taking place.\nyou need to be aware of the relative ratios of the heat and the nebulizing gas and nitrogen nebulizing gas in order to optimize the electrospray.\nPart 2A Infusion, FIA #  So lecture two, we have a lecture 2 a, b and c. This is on introducing liquids into the mass spectrometer, infusion flow injection analysis, infusion or the two different things. This is a famous cartoon on the left. Patrick Arpino was a postdoc here at Cornell long ago. And he and I were got in the early days of LCMS. And there were a lot of people against LCMS. At the time, how can you possibly do that? A, a beast familiar and comfortable in the gas phase, the bird and a beast like the fish that\u0026rsquo;s comfortable and at home and the liquid phase? How can these two have a relationship that shows the hearts going on and so it was actually reproduced many times. And as I understand it, Patrick is a Frenchman and he went in the mountains of France on holiday and conceived this idea. 2030 some odd years later, Tom cubby from sciex made a modern version of that. And there was a meeting at Pitzer conference in Orlando. And there was an evening at Disney World, I think. And they have the jumbotron, great big TV screen Jumbotron. And he had this cartoon on the Jumbotron in celebration of LCMS. Again, the burden the gas phase and the fish and the condensed phase. How can they have a relationship? Well, personally, I like to have tell me, someone told me something can\u0026rsquo;t be done, or it\u0026rsquo;s impossible or difficult, or it will never, it\u0026rsquo;ll never work. And so we did work on that. And it did take quite a while the earliest days of LCMS, go back to the late 70s. Commercially, there in 1979, there was a to two approaches. What is now thermal was then called Finnegan had a way of doing LCMS. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer used. And Hewlett Packard, which is now Agilent had another way of doing it and has evolved since then. And both of those techniques are dinosaurs. Now they\u0026rsquo;re not used at all it was before electrospray and before APCI, and so forth.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;d like to start this out by saying that this liquid phase introduction you should not take lightly it\u0026rsquo;s it is straightforward. Now you can take it lightly, but appreciate how challenging it might have been one people were used to helium as a carrier gas and GC and EI. So ways of introducing is infusion. If you are unfortunate enough to need a blood blood transfusion, you\u0026rsquo;re going to hospital and somebody infuses blood or to you. That\u0026rsquo;s what infusion is only. we\u0026rsquo;re going to use a small pump and infusion pump or a reciprocating pump to continuously introduce a solution of a drug or a molecule some chemical, usually not a mixture, but it could be a mixture. In contrast to that is flowing injection analysis, I like to call that LCMS without the LC, there is no column and FIA if you will. FIA is a popular technique and important technique and other fields. It\u0026rsquo;s a quick way of taking a quick look at a sample by by the mass spectrometer using atmospheric pressure ionization, you can either use an autosampler, or manual syringe to inject into the flowing stream or sovereign mobile phase, if you will, going to the mass spectrometer, but more analytically useful is HPLC. And of course, these days we have ULP UPLC, or UHPLC, ultra high price I mean performance, we\u0026rsquo;ll see that sometimes call but it\u0026rsquo;s a revolutionary breakthrough.\nCapillary GC, if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever done capillary GC with a 30 meter column, you have hundreds of 1000s of theoretical plates. I like to remind us that we buy LC columns from vendors and they say it\u0026rsquo;s 100,000 plates per meter. But who buys a one meter long LC column? Nobody. They\u0026rsquo;re usually five centimeters, one centimeter 10 centimeters is a long one. And so an HPLC, we typically had a few 1000 plates, which is not much, UHPLC has dramatically improved that, it\u0026rsquo;s still not as good as capillary GC, but it\u0026rsquo;s got much more separation efficiency, analytical horsepower, and so UHPLC is now readily available online with mass spectrometry, other forms of chromatography or ion chromatography, usually for ions in solution that can be inorganic ions and can ions or organic ions, ions and cations, inorganic or bromine, bromide, fluoride, those kinds of things or metals, calcium, magnesium, those kinds of things, or organically it\u0026rsquo;s phosphates or perchlorates, perchlorates and wastewater, environmental people use ion chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. And then of course, a supercritical fluid chromatography which is used as CO2 under high pressure as a mobile phase, the polarity of CO2 is analogous to hexane, very nonpolar material. And it\u0026rsquo;s fast, it behaves like a gas. Even though it\u0026rsquo;s a it\u0026rsquo;s a liquid as it\u0026rsquo;s compressed. Another very different form of separation science, not chromatography, is capillary electrophoresis. Sometimes called Capillary Zone electro faces?, this is a nanoscale technique. It\u0026rsquo;s often a one meter long fused silica capillary that\u0026rsquo;s 100 microns ID, and you have 30,000 volts across it after you let go. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to touch this, it\u0026rsquo;s usually an NS insulated container or box. But capillary electrophoresis is good for ions in solution, whether they be peptides or proteins, or, or organic molecules that can be in the presence of acid which makes them an ion or in the presence of a base, which makes them an anion. So a capillary electrophoresis was available commercially. 25 years ago, there were almost 10 vendors and they all went out of business. Well, not almost all of them did have a few hung around. But the technique was ahead of its time. It has now come back, there\u0026rsquo;s a number of folks talking about CEE for capillary electrophoresis for peptides and proteins. It has very high separation efficiency. Unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of slow. If you look at the runtime, which is called migration time, you don\u0026rsquo;t have retention in C, you have migration, relative migration under a high electric field. And oftentimes, it\u0026rsquo;s 10s of minutes, as in 3040 minutes, if you will, but very high separation. I was involved in this early on, and was excited about it. But it is a nanoscale technique. So the sample loading, you don\u0026rsquo;t put micrograms, or even high nanograms on this column. Remember, it\u0026rsquo;s 100 microns ID, and you can easily overload it. And so very small amounts of sample are on it. And therefore you need a very sensitive mass spectrometer detector to see if those now exist. When I did it, they weren\u0026rsquo;t very sensitive, and it was very difficult to get practical results. It is commercially available from two or three vendors, Agilent, Sciex, and so forth. There are other forms of separation science, but these are the main ones. Anybody know of one that I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned here, a separation science inlet system, what have I not mentioned? Now homework assignment.\nAlright, and infusion of a calibration solution, I hope you just saw that we have two little vials on our CMS that have a calibration solution that can be infused under pressure. With gas pressure, we don\u0026rsquo;t have a pump for it, we have a headspace but a gentle pressure on the surface of the liquid, it pushes it through its capillary to the ion source. That\u0026rsquo;s a simple way of doing that. And from that, we can have a series of ions because it\u0026rsquo;s usually a mixture of compounds, you ought to know what those are, you don\u0026rsquo;t know what the what the masses are, so you know what to expect them what to look for. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we use that reference compound or positive on or negative on one or the other. By the way, our system can do positive negative switching, you can actually rapidly multiplex back and forth, and you need to have mass calibrated and tuned under positive ions and negative ion so that those tuning files are available for rapid switching, you need to think about that.\nSo flow injection analysis, a simple cartoon, here\u0026rsquo;s the mass spectrometer, the detector, there\u0026rsquo;s an isocratic pump, any kind of a pump, even an infusion pump, you could actually use an infusion pump. But using infusion pumps are limited to very low flow rates, this shows 10 to 500 microliters per minute 10 microliters, we certainly can do but it takes a lot longer. And typically we use a higher flow rate. The sweet spot for these for modern LCMS is two or 300 microliters per minute going to the source, you can do less, you can do more, if you do less, it takes longer, like the Think of the linear velocity of the solid and going through the capillaries, it\u0026rsquo;s if it\u0026rsquo;s really 10 microliters, or five microliters per minute, it takes a while to go this kind of a distance. So linear velocity through there is very slow. And that\u0026rsquo;s a function of the inside diameter, you might want to think about that sometimes. we will will purchase peak tubing that\u0026rsquo;s even smaller inside diameter. The downside of that is you can plug it up with particles if you\u0026rsquo;re dirty if you\u0026rsquo;re have particles in your solvent if you don\u0026rsquo;t centrifuge or filter solvents, keeping things clean and particulate free is very helpful has let you have a good ride home at night rather than a bad ride wondering what went wrong in your laboratory. And so a few 100 microliters let\u0026rsquo;s say 200 microliters minute can be done and we have this valve on the front of our system is switched a realign valve. And manually you can use a syringe to load the loop switch the valve and that\u0026rsquo;s a plug of sample going to the mass spectrometer that\u0026rsquo;s flow injection analysis and simple way. If you have a more sophisticated system, you can have an auto sample that repeatedly does it every 30 seconds. Something like that. Why would you want to do that? That\u0026rsquo;s one way of optimizing the sensitivity because every time that peak comes up, you see it this high, I want it higher. So I make a change in the tuning. Next Next injection it goes up or goes down, meaning I went the wrong direction. It\u0026rsquo;s a one way to manually or automated optimize the tuning for sensitivity. Many of you that are interviewed, typically involved in what I would call trace analysis or high sensitivity analysis, your synthetic chemists, that\u0026rsquo;s the other problem they have too much sampler, granted. So anybody can trace analysis, low nanograms sub nanogram, the NES is not roll, I would possibly be interested in that for some forensic experiments. I don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone\u0026rsquo;s in particularly if you started looking at like, you know, toxicity. Tables Absolutely. Might, yep. Well, we\u0026rsquo;re interested in breath analysis. And there are drugs and breath. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple way for a policeman to collect a sample on the road. But the and there are drugs in that breath, but it\u0026rsquo;s low picogram per mil, if you will, very low level. So we sometimes are searching for optimizing the sensitivity, that is a need for that application. But your application doesn\u0026rsquo;t need so much sensitivity. So define what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to do and focus on that.\nSo flow injection analysis, simple ideas, not LCMS, because there\u0026rsquo;s no LC Column, you get a peek to comes up. And I\u0026rsquo;ll show you in a minute what they look like. Like so there\u0026rsquo;s the injector valve that you put a syringe in there, you load the loop, that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s not an injection, you don\u0026rsquo;t inject until you switch the knob, you call it load, and then inject by switching that up. And then you go back with a knob for the next sample. So as I say, here, you might call this LCMS without the LC. So here\u0026rsquo;s an example of FIA. So here\u0026rsquo;s a six minute time period, it\u0026rsquo;s very fast. I like it, because I\u0026rsquo;m impatient. And I can run lots of samples in a short length of time, but I\u0026rsquo;m not doing LCMS. And not a bad thing. But let me highlight your what you see here, these peaks tail, they go up nice and sharp. But if that was an LC peak, I would worry about it not being symmetrical, it\u0026rsquo;s got a tail to it, not a big deal. But it takes a while for this to dissipate. And that affects how rapidly I can re inject another sample. So here are replicates of four 5,10 20, presumably nanograms per ml, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what the units are here. But it\u0026rsquo;s very reproducible. But one of these peaks looks like this. And it\u0026rsquo;s just for your reference. That\u0026rsquo;s a 15. second run,\nWho ever heard of newborn screening. Every baby developed, developed, every baby born in the developed world, US Europe, lots of other places, has a heel prick of a dried blood spot. And before that maybe goes home at that blood spot is sent this been done since the 80s, or even before way back to the 60s, but not by mass spec. But all newborn screening is done by flow injection analysis, because they get millions of samples a year, the New York State Department of Health has eight LCMSMS systems and their laboratory running millions of samples a year. So the dried blood spot is sent in the mail to the laboratory before the baby go home that goes home, that sample that blood spot is extracted. And it\u0026rsquo;s actually derivatized and analyzed by flow injection analysis. Because of time, they want to do it very quickly. And they\u0026rsquo;re using MSMS. Remember, LCMS is not a triple quad, we cannot do MSMS tandem mass spectrometry, and that\u0026rsquo;s a form of mixture analysis. LC is a form of mixture analysis. But if you have MSMS, some sometimes you can get away with not having the LC sometimes we use LCMsMs. And that\u0026rsquo;s the ultimate and selectivity. And so just an example of a real successful application of flow injection analysis by mass spectrometry is newborn screening. And what they\u0026rsquo;re screening for is inborn errors of metabolism Carnot teens, in our body, we have about 21 related carnitine. And these are biomarkers for health and disease. And they\u0026rsquo;re looking for a panel a normal panel. And if a baby has some issues with with metabolism errors, it\u0026rsquo;ll show up very nicely by different amounts of these carnitine. And that baby, if not corrected, will live maximum of three years. If it\u0026rsquo;s corrected and the diet has changed. I live a perfectly normal life. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge success story from our spectrometry. And anybody who\u0026rsquo;s had a baby in their family in the recent past 25 years, 20 years probably. I mentioned earlier, fab fast down bombardment in the 80s. Newborn screening was tried by fab, which was a very cantankerous technique, persnickety, not high throughput and so forth. And we were working with electrospray at Cornell, and I know the folks that started doing that. And so why are you using that technique? Why don\u0026rsquo;t you try this new technique? I can\u0026rsquo;t take no credit for it. Other than that, they tried it. And that\u0026rsquo;s the way it\u0026rsquo;s all done now. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge success store across the world, major laboratories and develop countries do that.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s negative ions, I like to say there\u0026rsquo;s nothing negative about negative ion mass spectrometry. And if you think chemistry, think organic chemistry, why when I look at a molecule, I started looking very closely for functional groups like that, that\u0026rsquo;s a sulphonic acid. If you know your organic chemistry, you\u0026rsquo;ll know that that\u0026rsquo;s a strong organic acid. And you can readily deprotonate it with a slight amount of ammonium hydroxide 0.1% In your mobile phase, you will pluck off that hydrogen and you will have an [M-H]- molecule weight minus one. And so here then as a flow injection analysis, pique, not an LC peak, notice it tails. But the mass spectrum is shown here. And it\u0026rsquo;s shown by these arrows, the fragmentation proposed to be taking place to give the 367 ion, which is that ion the 421, which is the deprotonated molecule, and is 339 ion. So negative ion detection, if you know your molecule, and if it\u0026rsquo;s got a acidic hydrogen, what has acidic hydrogens sulphonic acids in decreasing acidity. Sulphonic acids that are highest, strongest carboxylic acid, COOH are the next for Knowles, -OH on an aromatic ring, not alcohols. But funnels funnels are aromatic alcohols, they are acidic. And last but not least, are alpha one, three die keto compounds of acid, the hydrogens between two carbon eels are very acidic. And so the other thing you may not appreciate is the negative ion mode, the chemical background that gets in our way of the positive ion, there are many fewer molecules in the background of our systems that respond to negative ions. So the chemical noise goes down, because it does not get deprotonated. So I will lean towards negative ion detection, if I\u0026rsquo;m after sensitivity, want the chemical noise go down, and so forth. So don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of negative ion detection. But learn how to do it, you need to calibrate and tune your mass spectrometer negative ion mode, very easy to do. One of those files on the right is for negative ion tuning, and then set up your tune file and then go forward and has to do with organic chemistry flow injection analysis.\nImportant part There\u0026rsquo;s a dirty little secret that we and LCMS you should know. And that\u0026rsquo;s called carryover, you inject a sample, especially from your organic chemists a lot of sample and it sticks that chemical sticks to certain surfaces in the flowing path, or is it start the the stator and rotor itself the injector itself, the frits on the column, mainly the inlet for it. But also if you have a lot of sample the exit fret along the inside surfaces, a fresh tubing if you change your pick tubing or a few silica regularly, that\u0026rsquo;s a fresh virgin surface. And the first few few injections will may not even get to the mass spectrometer because your trace level drug and if you\u0026rsquo;re running lots of samples, it\u0026rsquo;s a non issue. It\u0026rsquo;s when you\u0026rsquo;re doing trace analysis that too can have this happen. So if we have carryover occur and we inject a sample, we see a nice big peak. If we inject a blank Next, we may still see that peak, even though there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have anything in it. Now what\u0026rsquo;s the blank? I\u0026rsquo;m going to go too long here, I have too much to say. There are solid blanks. And there are matrix blanks that if you\u0026rsquo;re doing LCMS from biological samples, you\u0026rsquo;re not the solvent blank will show a nice clean injection, when in fact, there\u0026rsquo;s actually carryover because a solvent does nothing to displace the stuck molecule. This is called nonspecific binding, sticky compounds. Some compounds are very sticky peptides among them, and they will stick to certain surfaces inside it. If you inject a negative controlled plasma blank or biological blank. That means that next track the plasma known to be free of the drug, if you inject that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of other things in there. There\u0026rsquo;s lipids and phospholipids and peptides, and so forth. Those chemicals will displace the sticky compound and you\u0026rsquo;ll see a carryover. So anybody remember the OJ Simpson trial, some of you probably are old enough, the trial of the century that was subpoenaed for that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to go out at the last minute. But the FBI in Quantico, Virginia were received samples from mo J\u0026rsquo;s from the thumb the blood that was collected from the fence and the sidewalk and so forth. And they use a solid blank. Five of them are read repositre commissioned last three jobs, because there really was carryover and you\u0026rsquo;re using a solvent plate they couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it. So you always use of new biological samples or real samples or environmental sample, you should choose a negative control matrix playing. If you\u0026rsquo;re just doing something like this, perhaps a solid blank is good enough but understand that solid may not displace it. If you want to optimize your chances of getting rid of any carryover, certain solvent Like isopropanol, as opposed to methanol, some of the heavier alcohols are better solvents and a solid blank to displace them more than you want to know. Important part end\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s a number of tricks that you need to know in this world. Solid like ethanol, methanol, water, just solid, no chemicals at all. Solid. Good question. Thank you. So here are a success of injections and there\u0026rsquo;s carry over and each one. So this, this chemical is stuck on the surfaces. And you need to do this, if you\u0026rsquo;re really worried about care, or if you don\u0026rsquo;t care doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. You\u0026rsquo;re just looking at whether the correct ions are that\u0026rsquo;s one thing. But a quantitative analysis, we must demonstrate no carryover, we always start with a calibration curve from low concentration to high. we inject the lowest one first and the next one, the next one, the next one, because injecting the highest level first has the highest chance of carryover. Okay, here\u0026rsquo;s flow injection analysis with a column I would call this LCMS. So there\u0026rsquo;s the column different from what we saw before. And if we inject a sample here, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have chromatographic separation. If we have an isocratic pump, we\u0026rsquo;re not varying the mobile phase at all. And they made to be a long run and maybe a short run, you may have to mix and match the solvents to get this optimized. But in this case, you got to do flow injection with a column in line. And that would be by manually injecting with a syringe. Of course, the syringe needs to be clean. Usually the needle itself is the culprit with carryover. So that brings us to the end of that A 2A.\nPart 2B ESI #  important part [21:31] Alright, this is a picture I took in front of my barn at home to to talk about a spray. One of the things that can go wrong with electrospray or APCI, is you instead of having a nice spray, now this is not electrospray. This is a garden hose, right. But if you\u0026rsquo;re washing off your the soap from your car, or for whatever reason you want a nice spray, unreasonably nice spray looks like that. But if you have an LCMS, if you have a particle stuck in your tube, and the sprayer, the sprayer itself, remember I said this morning, the sprayer has high voltage on it, the liquids coming through at 200 microliters per minute, and it\u0026rsquo;s possible to get a particle stuck in there. And that\u0026rsquo;s analogous to how when your thumb in there and you have a asymmetrical spray, you\u0026rsquo;ll have terrible sensitivity, you\u0026rsquo;ll have unstable ion current noise that ion current will be noisy. And that\u0026rsquo;s an indication of a problem and you need to fix it before you go on. You\u0026rsquo;ve often cannot see this spray, depending upon the lighting in the room, the flow rate, and whether it\u0026rsquo;s high methanol or high water, you may have trouble seeing it. Sometimes you can actually hear it. Maybe the lab our lab, my colleagues can show you that in a laboratory. But it\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of this slide is to show that you need to have asymmetrical spray. And it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to know it, the most common indication is terrible sensitivity or unstable ion current, noisy peaks don\u0026rsquo;t accept that. You need to stop and fix whatever the issue is before that happens. So large droplets with electrospray are not successful. We don\u0026rsquo;t have good sensitivity if we have large droplets. Long ago, I took our system to Georgia Tech, there was a professor down there that has scat laser scattering measurement you can measure droplets droplet size, and they are sub micron sub sub micron droplets when electrospray works the best. And we use a combination of heat and nebulizing gas and time to get droplets as they come from the sprayer where the where they\u0026rsquo;re fairly large down to the point where we have ion evaporation taking place.\nSlide: Schematic of Electrospray Process #  [23:34] So this is an old diagram of electrospray we have this needle it\u0026rsquo;s nowhere near as large inside diameter, think syringe needle 10 microliters syringe needle, 100 microns inside diameter, liquid going through mobile phase methanol water 0.1% formic acid for example. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s 0.1% ammonium hydroxide, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s 0.1% Triethyl amine a base, there\u0026rsquo;s a few things we can use as bases in the mobile phase. So, we have a Taylor Cone. Taylor is on to describe this an early 20th century and it forms a jet of liquids like this and from the tips and I have a cartoon coming up later showing this from the tip m\u0026amp;a droplets and they get smaller and smaller because of nebulizing gas and because of evaporation and sometimes they actually undergo emission daughter droplets come from the mother droplets. So this is an example of a forming daughter droplet. And we believe that has happened several generations very, very quickly this happens and in fractions of a second if you will, and at some point these ions are in solution undergo ion evaporation and create a positive charged ion in the gas phase that we have these droplets going in this hole.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like the mass spectrometer drinking from a firehose and we see no ions. We must have gas phase ions at this region we\u0026rsquo;re making 1000s of them, what percentage do you think we get inside the mass spectrometer, one in 10,000. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing these things are as sensitive as they are, we\u0026rsquo;re only sampling a small fraction, the new developments and mass spectrometry has been ion optics to focus them to get in there, as well as larger holes, you can get more ions in a larger hole. And so we and other vendors, the other vendors have worked on that. you might add, you should appreciate that this is a miniature vacuum cleaner, one of the factors helping ions get in there as they\u0026rsquo;re being sucked in. But not too many get in that way. We need to have a voltage potential between this interface plate and this sprayer, a potential difference that makes the ions unlike teenagers go where we want them to go. More new want to know but it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to optimize the system to understand what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do, you must have tiny droplets. So we want to form these.\nSlide: Electrospray #  [25:54] So electrospray it\u0026rsquo;s first and foremost, it\u0026rsquo;s a spray process. Cars are painted by electrospray, gallons of paint. Why can\u0026rsquo;t we spray gallons of methanol water because they\u0026rsquo;re not doing mass spectrometry, they\u0026rsquo;re just trying to hit a car. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of examples of electrospray in other apps, well not a lot, but other examples, Ion evaporation produce gas phase ions takes place.\nIons are formed by three major steps:\nproduction of charged droplets at the capillary tip. the sprayer the spray capillary We refer to the to a capillary that\u0026rsquo;s the inlet capillary where the ions go into the initial stage, but this is the sprayer capillary, the probe, if you will.\nshrinkage of the charged droplets by solvent evaporation and repeated droplet disintegrations at that daughter ion and granddaughter ion mechanism only to very small highly charged droplets capable of producing gas phase ions by Ion vaporation. So then ion evaporation takes place from the condensed phase of a highly charged droplet. You can what does it take to incr to increase evaporation？ heat, our system our probe is heated, the sprayer is heated, there\u0026rsquo;s an optimum temperature depending upon your molecule. And the flow rate. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to flow it 50 microliters per minute, that\u0026rsquo;s a really low flow rate, you don\u0026rsquo;t need so much rate you should know enough to not use, too much rate you\u0026rsquo;ll paralyze it. Or if you\u0026rsquo;re or if you have way too high a flow rate and then you will, it\u0026rsquo;ll be suboptimal also, it\u0026rsquo;s not real critical, but you need to be aware of the ratio relative ratios of the heat and the nebulizing gas and nitrogen nebulizing gas. Some people use air as a nebulizing gas, that\u0026rsquo;s okay if your molecules don\u0026rsquo;t oxidize because in air is oxygen, sulfides will readily be oxidized to cell phones and sulfoxides. amines are rarely docs readily oxidized by air, the oxygen in the air to salt night and oxides and so forth. So we generally recommend using nitrogen. And that won\u0026rsquo;t happen.\nSlide: Electronspray Process #  So here\u0026rsquo;s a nice video of the electrospray process. There\u0026rsquo;s an audio but it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to hear. So let\u0026rsquo;s just watch it. This is not electrospray This is before like to spray, these are just droplets from a sprayer, there\u0026rsquo;s an electric field around the tip that\u0026rsquo;s produced by the sprayer voltage and the counter electrode at the front of the mass spectrometer there is a spray. And if you look at it just right in lighter, you can see the spray even in our system, there\u0026rsquo;s the cone, the jet and the field. And so this is a cartoon of that electrospray process that Taylor cone and the droplets emanate from the tip of that jet. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to see that but it is possible little droplets form and they get smaller and smaller. There\u0026rsquo;s a daughter droplet being formed, these are splitting. And so that\u0026rsquo;s believed to be the mechanism for all electrospray process. A method by which ions present in solution can be transferred to the gas phase.\nSlide: Pneumatically assisted electrospray #  [29:07] A pneumatically assisted electrospray ion spray for what it\u0026rsquo;s worse for what it\u0026rsquo;s worth. Ions spray was a patent at Cornell in my laboratory in 1986. So we were doing looking at pure electrospray and wanting to do LCMS pure electrospray, which is now done in the form of nano electrospray. Have you heard of nano electrospray? very, very low flow rates 100 Nano liters per minute, instead of 100 microliters, a thousandfold lower spray. People in the proteomics field need lots of sensitivity. We\u0026rsquo;re going to see in a moment that that electrospray is a concentration sensitive detector. So the lower the flow, the smaller the peak volume in the LC peak, the more sensitivity we\u0026rsquo;ll have. And so we were forced to try to do in the early 80s electrospray and people were doing a mil per minute LC that was before micro LC See earlier it was a milliliter per minute, some people still do that. And electrospray was incompatible with that we wanted to have the ability to accommodate a higher flow rate. And we developed had a postdoc visiting scientists at the time Andris Bruins from the Netherlands and together we developed pneumatically assisted electrospray. It\u0026rsquo;s on every commercial system sold on the planet today.\nSlide: Ion spray LC/MS Interface #  So what is electrospray with pneumatic systems? it\u0026rsquo;s a tube in a tube. And this drawing we\u0026rsquo;ve seen a central capillary that carries the liquid from the LC pump terminating at the exit right here, but instead is a tube that\u0026rsquo;s inside of another capillary shown here with an annular space between the wall, the outer capillary and the wall of the inner capillary. If we apply a high linear velocity of nitrogen gas, it emanates out the terminus here and disperses the droplets and helps evaporate. That\u0026rsquo;s what we call the pneumatically assisted electrospray and helps us form gas phase ions as shown here. And this allows us to be able to cope with higher HPLC flow rates. Every instrument without HPLCMS capability sold on in the world today has this capability associated with it.\nSlide #  Here\u0026rsquo;s the hardware Advion a nebulizing gas is showing you here this plastic tube the nebulizing gas I described his interest there that he had gas enters in this region. And if you\u0026rsquo;re an ion, mid tones Kappeler This is where you come from. Here is the otter he had gas the nebulizer gas coaxial and the senator capillary is where the solvent comes on forms the ions and that\u0026rsquo;s the heart of the our electrospray medical system electrospray system. So, what are the variables and electrospray each can effectively electrospray results, the sprayer voltage is commonly 3500 volts, it can be increased to 2500 volts and positive ion negative ion operation we typically start a little bit lower at 2500 volts. And these can be adjusted. Usually the adjustments do not affect the sensitivity dramatically. But sometimes it does. And sometimes depending upon the compound rather than increasing this voltage, if you lower the voltage, what do we call global electrospray this may produce improved sensitivity. Depending upon the compound, it\u0026rsquo;s worth a try. And the amount of reduction in voltage can be substantial despite the blower to 2000 even 1500 volts and sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll see a dramatic improvement in sensitivity, the gas the nebulizer gas and heated gas. These are generally set in fixed temperatures but they can be varied.\nAnother factor is the liquid flow rate. slower is better within the region of 200 microliters per minute higher can be accommodated but ion current stability can be deteriorated as well as sensitivity. So 200 microliters per minute or point two mils per minute is a real good sweet spot for good performance.\nThe spray composition the mobile phase itself, the percentage of organic and aqueous solvent is important. The best results are obtained with a higher organic percentage and in that mobile phase. Sometimes additives like acid are based can change the pH and improve situations also it\u0026rsquo;s a variable it\u0026rsquo;s important. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about in a moment, the spray foam temperature, the gas temperature is a factor that can be varied to some degree and cause some improvements. And certainly atmospheric conditions that chemicals and allow the environment the unit in the room. These are less important these days because the source is housed in a closed system with nitrogen gas.\nBut each of these does in fact, represent a variable that the operator can choose to change the mechanisms for electrospray. historically and then two models, most common one for small molecules is called the evaporation model. And that shown here a droplet with ions in solution undergoes evaporation they get smaller and smaller and still smaller. And at some point an evaporation goes takes place or what\u0026rsquo;s called Cool big explosion giving some protein molecule that ion in solution. This is generally believed to be the accepted mechanism for small molecules and alternative dough mechanism that may explain the performance and results from auto spray generation of very large molecules like proteins is called the charge resident model. This was proposed quite some time ago by knocking door this model envisions ion. ions in the droplet droplet gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and eventually also when it\u0026rsquo;s gone and the residue ends the charge residue model is all it\u0026rsquo;s left in the region of the orifice and mastic trauma. So it is believed that in some cases with large molecules this may be the mechanism taking place.\nA summary that ion production deal is firmly linked to droplet size, small droplets or best nano spray is known to produce so micro droplets and for Use correspondingly high yields. Narrow spring counselors but instruments carry more charge and giving us multi charged ions. The best spray produces small droplets and significantly higher ion yields electrospray is affected by flow rates higher, the worse you can get gas nebulizer gas and heated gas, the spreader boulders to some degree pH, electrochemical effects and acid base chemistry and the solution coming off [ALC COMM??].\nThe mobile phase strategies for adjusting pH of HPLC, Iowa, for optimum performance for positive ion detection analyzed becomes a candidate, usually by protonation protonation of an addition of acid, formic acid pH three to four CDs, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, three to four formic acid from two to three, and the pH at least two pH balance below the pKa of amlight. So we ideally have nearly 100% of the molecules in there protonated ionic form and negative ion detection and limes become an add on these analyzed or acids, which can be deprotonated and increase the pH using one of my dropside try it out for me or try methyl me again pH and these two PHS have both a pKa of a compound that will give us an anion solution.\nSo what do we do? Well, we have a neutral compound which is almond acid. Nowadays, the anolyte forms ADOX with a cow ion or an ally I analyzation is via attic formation with Callahans or anions. Typical examples are ammonium ion, sodium ion, lithium, potassium and some others. These are how we protonate or format ions of neutral compounds. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at acid base chemistry. And remember some important basics that are important LCMS the aqueous mobile phase for LC the aqueous phase is rarely just water usually contains on acid, a base or buffering age reagents. And light chemical properties are important. It\u0026rsquo;s the pKa or the decay we have analyzed influence the LC retention and the ionization of the master counter, this marriage of these two techniques must be compromised so that each can take place. And finally the mass spectrometer ion source electrospray ionization sources greatly are greatly influenced by acid base chemistry. And this slide, we look at the addition of strong acid the water here we remind ourselves that the pH is equal to negative log of a hydrogen ion concentration, and that this is a logarithmic form and as a factor of 10. And the difference between a pH of five and pH six. So we take a look at some of these equations, we have water of an acid added and we have this equation, that gives us a reduction of the pH to the lower end of the pH scale.\nInstead, if we add base, and such as a line by dioxide and water, we have this equation. And that gives us this equation, which will shift the pH to the opposite side of the pH scale. A skill being shown here on changes in pH are not good. We\u0026rsquo;d like to buffer the pH mobile phase and maintain a given narrow range of pH. And that\u0026rsquo;s really the additional facet or based or ideally to form a buffering reagent. So how can we maintain the pH we want in your region. Here\u0026rsquo;s the basic situation. And there\u0026rsquo;s the acidic if you will. And so it\u0026rsquo;s a balancing act, who can use the metaphor of a Teeter-Totter. Think of the chemical equilibrium of a Teeter-Totter. If you would change things like adding acid than your weight, like putting heavy person on the Teeter-Totter weights it that way, we do this make this change, we neutralize it and come back oops, I went too far. come back in this direction, we want to maintain a balance within a pH range. And that\u0026rsquo;s if you remember a shot liaise principle way back equilibrium law. And that\u0026rsquo;s buffer control and LCMS. A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t remember it, don\u0026rsquo;t use it. But it can be very helpful in optimizing results. If you maintain the pH and the preferred region based on what your compound needs. When the equilibrium is stirred, is disturbed and insert an adjustment is made to bring it back. And here\u0026rsquo;s an example of that. Here\u0026rsquo;s our pH scale. Now going all the way out to 14, but a solution of a weak acid or base and its conjugate base or acid salts, we have this equation pH is equal to this ratio between basic base and acid. The buffer resists a small change that\u0026rsquo;s that Teeter-Totter keep wanting to keep it level and range.\nAnd so we have this situation this equation that results in this equation and that moves this buffer capacity to a $\\pm$ 1 pH unit. We can be centered on a certain pH like five and we can go slightly up one or down one and remember nuts a factor of 10. And so a PHP K of five, the buffer ranges between four and six, the goal is to maintain the pH within four and six, that can be done with a proper buffer. That means it slides it down a little bit to the acidic side, but still within that range. And similarly, if you adjust the pH up, it goes only up to six. So $\\pm$ 1. Enough on that, but buffers are important and optimum performance is done.\nimportant Depending upon your molecule and its pKa, or its peak EP, PK be what pH range you need to be in. And remember, adding just something to a mobile phase does not mean it\u0026rsquo;s buffered. So ideal solvents. I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about the high boiling water 100 degrees, talked about methanol being 56. If we\u0026rsquo;re trying to evaporate droplets that make sense, we want as low boiling mixture as possible. So we ideal spray has low boiling point, a low dielectric constant and a low surface tension. And here are the solvents that are able to here\u0026rsquo;s the boiling points of each of these. Here\u0026rsquo;s a dielectric constant, the surface tension. And the ones in red are the ones we prefer. You can use others, there\u0026rsquo;s examples of using others, even THF. Some people in the polymer industry use tetrahydrofuran. But these are the most common ones that we use. And these are the additives.\nimportant ends\nAny questions on any of that? Okay, I mentioned before the electrospray behaves as a concentration sensitive detector. So here\u0026rsquo;s a T. samples coming in. And as a T, before the mass spectrometer, and so the solid is coming in the peak is coming off, and some of it goes to waste, and the rest of a small amount goes to the mass spectrometer. People unfamiliar with this concept, think oh, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna lose sensitivity, I\u0026rsquo;m throwing away my sample in electrospray, that is not true, you get the same response for the it all goes in or not. And here\u0026rsquo;s an example from Tom cubby some years back from from sciex. So here\u0026rsquo;s two compounds, here\u0026rsquo;s the area counts. This is 400 microliters per minute, all of it going to the ion source. So this is the response is getting from all of it going here is a split 132 microliters to the source, like one 1/3. The other part going to be collected, the counts are comparable. They\u0026rsquo;re not exact, but those are big numbers. They\u0026rsquo;re comparable, you have not lost sensitivity. taking one step further, only 15 microliters going to the source, most of its going to waste again these numbers are comparable electrospray behaves as a concentration sensitive detector. That is why doing nano electrospray or micro LC gives you sensitivity. So follow me through this example. We have 200 microliters per minute. We have a 2.1 microliter column, millimeter 2.1 millimeter ID, we\u0026rsquo;re flowing at 200 microliters per minute, the peak is 30 seconds while the LCP try to follow me, the peak is 30 seconds wide. What\u0026rsquo;s the peak vial 30 seconds 200 microliters. That\u0026rsquo;s 100 microliter volume peak. So we\u0026rsquo;re getting a signal from that. Now let\u0026rsquo;s go to a nano LC column, the the extreme are at 75 micron calm, it\u0026rsquo;s operating at 200 Nano liters per minute 1000 times lower flow rate. And that\u0026rsquo;s still a 32nd wide peak 200 microliters per minute, what\u0026rsquo;s the peak volume 100 microliters, the concentration of that anolyte By the way, it is 10 nanograms anolyte in each example. So the 10 nanograms is in 100 microliters, the other 10 nanograms is in is in 100 nanometers to dramatic improvement 30 to 100 fold increase in sensitivity, would you take that pay pay increase when you go home. So that\u0026rsquo;s because electrospray behaves as a concentration sensitive detector.\nThat is not true for APCI behaves as a mass flow sensor detector like a UV Neph on that. So splitting is counterintuitive, does not kill to give me a sensitivity if you\u0026rsquo;re doing quantitation. And if you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with synthetic organic, organic chemists like my friend over here, or they bring in so much sample electrospray can be very linear. This is a standard curve. And it\u0026rsquo;s linear up to a certain point, if you put too much sample into the mass spectrometer with electrospray, it becomes nonlinear. This is a logarithmic scale. So it\u0026rsquo;s actually much more of a smooth bend, if you will, but too much sample becomes nonlinear injecting twice as much will not give you twice the area. So electrospray is nonlinear at high concentrations, micrograms injected, will give you a nonlinear report response. That\u0026rsquo;s only important if you want to keep the instrument clean, or if you\u0026rsquo;re not doing quantitation if you\u0026rsquo;re just doing qualitative analysis that\u0026rsquo;s irrelevant.\nSummary\n[45:01] Okay summary the features for electrospray it\u0026rsquo;s volatile, pure low surface tension solvents like methanol or acetonitrile (CH3CN) are best, but others can be used able to produce very small droplets that\u0026rsquo;s why they\u0026rsquo;re good.\nThe analytes for electrospray can be polar INR ionizable any molecular weight 11 million molecule weight has been demonstrated by Carol Robinson at Cambridge. So any molecular weight and whether it\u0026rsquo;s acidic or basic and\nadditive salts keep below 20 millimolar, again more is not better. These salts compete for ionization with your analyte and by the way, phosphate buffers citrates are not good additives, they must be volatile additives like ammonium acetate, what is ammonium acetate become an amount spectrometer ammonium, ammonia, ammonia gas and acetic acid, formic acid. Similarly, volatile additives can be used.\neffects of water tends to produce less stable ion current, less sensitivity.\nthe mobile foot flow mobile rate, if you will, the lower the better for sensitivity 0.2 - 0.5 mils per minute, that\u0026rsquo;s 200 to 500 microliters per minute, is a sweet spot.\nSample matrix effects this can be a problem. the elephant a room with electrospray is it\u0026rsquo;s very sensitive to matrix suppression of ionization, sometimes matrix enhancement of ionization. So if you\u0026rsquo;re into biological samples like plasma, there\u0026rsquo;s phospholipids, they kill the sensitivity of a co-eluding molecule. And so the key is good chromatography or good sample preparation. So you minimize the endogenous chemicals that are in there.\nThe dynamic range, typically 500 to 1000, the dynamic range of the CMS is five orders of magnitude if it\u0026rsquo;s done well, from very low concentration to high concentration. So that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s relevant to quantitation. If you\u0026rsquo;re just doing qualitative analysis, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nSummary ends\nWhat about electrospray ionization for LCMS with normal phase solvents, what is a normal phase solvent hexane normal phase was the original chromatography and then came along reversed phase. And by the way, it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s reversed Ed hyphen, phase LCMS, republishing a paper, or talking to somebody that knows such such things as reverse phase, so it\u0026rsquo;s reversed from what it used to be. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called reverse phase. It\u0026rsquo;s reverse from normal Originally, the old chromatography was normal phase. And so apparent benefits Why might this be a good idea? low surface tension volatile solids, hexane is low surface tension and balls it should work better issues and solutions and solutions. electrospray depends on acid basically equilibrium, we need an ion solution, how are we going to get an ion in solution and hexane very polar ion, very nonpolar solvent doesn\u0026rsquo;t work very well. ions do like do not like being in hexane, alcohols or trace aqueous may be produced, introduced Postcomm. So sometimes normal phase is done with just one or two or 3% isopropanol. Maybe ethanol using not met methanol because it\u0026rsquo;s incisal, and hexane or you can go to APCI. A majority of the applications do not use normal Faisal Z, you can do it, but very few people do it. If you really want to do normal phase, you might want to do SFC, supercritical fluid chromatography, that\u0026rsquo;s CO2.\n[48:25] So 2B questions, does electrospray depend upon solution phase or gas phase chemistry electrospray depends upon solution phase chemists, your ION must be in that droplet in that solution as it goes through the column. One of the most favorable mobile phase flow rates for conditions either takeaway a muscle or muscle no kind of recapping, what I've just tried to suggest to you. mobile phase flow rates are that 200 to 500 microliters per minute, the closer to 200. Divided will work. Item three, what actually initiates the formation of ions and electrospray. And where do these come from? It's the sprayer voltage that creates a spray ions are already in solution, we want to get them out of the droplet in the gas phase. And that's done by evaporating the droplets to the point where they're so small, that the ions are all in there. So let's think about that. Imagine you've got a bunch of ions in a nano droplet, and they're all the same charge. What's happening? They're huge repulsion. Why do they evaporate out the droplet? They're dying to get away from each other the repulsive that like some people you might know, just want to get away from them. And so they columbic li explode out of the droplet because of repulsion. That's why they leave the droplet. What are the factors to consider regarding matrix effects electrospray, a co eluding endogenous Kemo in plasma it would be a phosphor lipid. It could be a variety of other things. If you're doing LCMS and something else comes off in that peak with your analyzer. Your analyzer signal will be suppressed likely\rthe pic is competing for the ion current basically, what HPLC mobile factors are important to consider for optimum electrospray results, the flow rate, the polarity of the solvents, the surface tension of the solvents, all those points that I summarize earlier, is electrospray plus preferred for small or large molecules, it's preferred for both, as long as they can be ions in solution. Not true for APCI. What factors can cause the formation of addicts to your to your compound in electrospray? If you cannot form a line in the solution of the neutral molecule cholesterol, you will have to form an addict and it's easy to do if you use a trace amount of ammonium acetate in your mobile phase, ammonium ion will add duct to cholesterol and it'll be 386 plus 18. It'll be ammonium adduct. What role does HPLC Elio mph have upon our ability to detect analyze, it has everything to do. It's the pH change by adding acid or base that creates the ions in solution by removing or a proton or adding a proton. What column LC column factors must be considered when pH change? Well, first and foremost columns are pretty stable these days, but you can actually by going to too high pH or too low pH, you can hydrolyze the column you can change the behavior of the stationary phase. There was a Seiler Nalls silicone, silicone attics, and so forth, and you can change it but more importantly, we want the analyte to be retained on the column. If you're not going to retain it, you might just will do Fia, right, there's no separation then take out the column and shorten things up. But your reason you're doing LC is to separate things you don't want from things you do want. And as Jen electrospray generally produce fragment ions, no, it's very mild ionization very gentle nothing like electron ionization. And finally, at the end, we have wrote relevant references to this this topic, a whole bunch of them three, three pages. Part 2C APCI #  [52:07] welcome to lecture two, Part C on atmospheric pressure ChemiCal ionisation for LCMS applications. This slide shows the chemical space for ionization techniques in the application range if we notice the x axis we go in terms of polarity from low polarity to high polarity and the y axis we have the molecular weight from less than 1000 lighter weights up to kilodaltons masses such as proteins. electrospray covers a large portion of this chemical space for proteins and peptides APCI the subject of this lecture covers a smaller space, but a unique set of compounds, where electrospray is somewhat less capable of giving us good results. These are steroids, nonpolar compounds, carbamates and even pH is polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. And so this gives us the complementarity indication of these two ionization techniques and may help you decide when to use one versus the other. This slide shows the APCI interface interface specifically we call it a heated pneumatic nebulizer. This brings an LC effluent into this blue line into a heated region inside this probe with nitrogen gas coaxial power coming in the nitrogen comes down through the T and comes out and mixes with the hot vapor generated by the heat and the probe. Very importantly, in the each region of the plump plume at this point we have the corona discharge needle, which is essentially a spark. This is the entrance to the vacuum system of the mass spectrometer where the ions that are formed here go into the mass spectrometer. And so this plume of vapor and volatilized molecules can be ionized by interaction with the discharge needle. What\u0026rsquo;s important to note with APCI, unlike electrospray, is that it\u0026rsquo;s the volatilize molecule your molecule must have sufficient vapor pressure under these conditions to be in the vapor state not in solution as with electrospray and so, if your molecule under these conditions and this can be quite hot in here, can be vaporized in this region here when they approach this region the discharge needle causes ionization, which is usually the formation of HCl plus a proton donor, which will donate a proton to your molecule. The actual chemistry we believe going occurring in this process in this region is shown here in step one or equation one nitrogen gas which has plenty of it because of the nebulizing gas interacts as electrons from the discharge needle to actually ionize the nitrogen to adopt plus or radical cat ion in the presence of excess nitrogen as shown here. That radical cat owner interacts to form an N four dot plus a an ionized nitrogen, if you will, also in the presence of lots of moisture, which is also often the case case with the LCMS with a water in the mobile phase that n four dot plus will interact with the water in forming a ionized water, this is charged exchange sometimes char called charge transfer the charge was on the nitrogen. Now it\u0026rsquo;s on the water that ion the probe that ionized water interacts with the other excess water present to finally produce what we need to pre a proton donor to our molecule, this is the hydronium ion. And this Genesis is formed. If the through this sequence of procedures, that species can then interact further and ultimately with your molecule and donate a proton to your molecule. That\u0026rsquo;s the mechanism of ionization for atmospheric pressure Chemical Ionization in positive iunknown mode, that would be that mechanism in the negative ion mode APCI can of course do that and then minus.is formed with oxygen is present addition to the neutral molecule to form an intermediate. So, species here name your work through this sequence and refer again to this schematic of the heated pneumatic nebulizer, we have o to minus interacting with your molecule your organic molecule to generate an M minus h minus the actual species that we are interested in that goes into the mass spectrometer and mass analyze. So APCI can generate both positive ions and negative ions. Atmospheric pressure Chemical Ionization the basics for APCI In summary, utilizes a corona discharge that needle must be there usually about 4000 volts are on it.\nA PCI is a four step process:\n the needle at high voltage ionizes nebulizing gas, the nitrogen, it\u0026rsquo;s the steam distillation, if you will, of the LC eluent goes past the H the high voltage needle. primary ions react immediately with neutral solvent ions forming reagent ions. or reagent ions in this case being predominantly the hydronium ion and that the reagent ions in react by proton transfer with the analyte forming molecules of [M+H]+ and a positive ion mode or in the negative ion mode and [M-H]-.  A summary of those simple experiments then are reactions are shown here for positive ion production HCL plus reacts with your molecule in the vapor form. That means your molecule in the heated probe has been vaporized. If this is not this technique is not amenable to proteins because they're very high molecular weight and have in very little vapor pressure and cannot be honest, but this method, so your molecule in the vapor form forms the n plus h plus plus water and the negative ion mold the B the minus species interacts to extract a proton from the acidic molecule to give the the m minus h minus structures of nine drugs are shown here, a mixture of these nine different compounds you can see some small molecules you can see some acid juice and see some basics and larger ones such as reserving each of these molecules is amenable to some degree to atmospheric pressure. Chemical Ionization here then is a chromatogram by LCMS, and about 12 minutes of these compounds with different abundances due to the response that they\u0026rsquo;re giving in the positive ion form mode with APCI. And as an alternative example, we have polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon 16 of them, we see no header atoms in any of these molecules, there\u0026rsquo;s no place for a proton to sit. There\u0026rsquo;s no very low proton affinity of these molecules. And so one might expect these would not work very well by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. In fact, they actually work quite nicely. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of LCMS determination of the 16 compounds, here are three separate ones, Naphthalene, Benzo-floranthene, and so forth, extracted out as their mass spectrum. What I want to highlight to bring your attention here is the molecule weight of naphthalene is 128. And the ion that we see is mass-to-charge 128, not the [M+H]+. why? because there\u0026rsquo;s no place to put a proton, these molecules are ionized. Similarly to electron ionization. they ionized by charge exchange or charge transfer. Similarly, this molecule molecule a 252, and we see a 252 ion and 278 is 278. So uniquely, unlike so much of electrospray or APCI, we do not see protonated species here, this is a unique benefit of APCI for these neutral molecules.\nHere is selected ion monitoring. LC/SIM analysis of those 16 compounds spiked in the water, and you can see each of them detected all 16 of them detected by monitoring there, there molecular ions. These are formal molecular ions because they\u0026rsquo;re radical cat ions.\nSo when should you use APCI LCMS sample analytes or neutral comp? less polar and difficult to ionize electrospray. If that is the case of your molecules, you might want to try APCI. You should also use it when the sample has sufficient vapor pressure sample meaning your analyte your chemical entities are are can have sufficient vapor to be vaporized in that hot plume in the region of the heat and ematic nebulizer, you can also use APCI when the flow rate, solvents, the matrix, and or additives are incompatible with electrospray.\nAPCI can handle a higher LCMS flow rate than electrospray up to a milliliter per minute. And also an operators these are easier operation conditions that means APCI is easy to do. LCMS is relatively easy using this technique, the discharge needle is always in the same place always uses the same voltage, there are fewer variables that must be addressed with APCI.\nAPCI - Heated Nebulizer (HN) Summary\nAnd this slide, we summarize the APCI heated nebulizer:\nthe flow rate can range from a half a mil to as much as two mils per minute. That\u0026rsquo;s a little bit on the high side that but that can be done.\nIf one is suitable for slightly polar thermally stable compounds\nthis technique is amenable usually like your weight of your molecules must be less than 1000. The higher the molecular weight of a molecule the less volatile it is, and\nthat we need that volatility to ionize it we might use it when the probe is heated to facilitate vaporization that is important aspect of this.\nIt requires a nebulizing and auxilary gas which is part of the system that we have and it requires a corona discharge needle to produce the ionization the simple discharge needle.\nAPCI Matrix Effects\nmatrix effects though, are an issue but a much less of an issue with APCI matrons of xr s can be a significant challenge with electrospray but less so with APCI. Generally, there are reduced matrix oppression of ionization with then relative to electrospray ionization, this is a different mechanism This is gas phase chemistry instead of solution phase chemistry, the neutrals are transferred into the gas phase by vaporizing the LC mobile phase effluent with heated nitrogen,\nthe sample matrix may affect the efficiency of charge transfer from the corona discharge needle.\nAnd occasional solid formation on discharge. natal can occur where ions cannot be a form but this is easily dealt with with routine maintenance of simply wiping off the discharge needle with either very, very science fine sandpaper or even a chem wipe, because carbon can build up on that needle.\nAPCI- Helpful Hints\n[1:02:36] Some helpful hints for APCI buffers and modifiers in the mobile phase are not required for ionization as they are also required in electrospray ionization. however, buffers may be helpful for the LC part of the separation, they are not necessary or useful for the ionization, biological buffers can be tolerated up to 50 millimolar concentration in the mobile phase and the year we can are able to handle the highest LC flow rates but optimal performance is probably achieved around a milliliter per minute.\nnormal phase prep scale, a lot of prep LC is done with Flash chromatography and it\u0026rsquo;s often as unknown or normal phase conditions. So here we have a total and current profile. And the extract that I in current profiles for three different dilates is shown here. And these are done often and nicely by normal phase chromatography. The LCCMS.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a structure. So interesting compounds. These are drugs. This is a Tetra hydro lipid statin THL. We have a D0 molecule. There\u0026rsquo;s no deuterated atoms present here. The D5 analog of THL is shown here with five determines this was a drug some years ago from Hofmann, Roche, it\u0026rsquo;s a fat lowering drug weight loss, if you will. And the question here is APCI as I\u0026rsquo;ve just discussed at LC MS by APCI, is that a good choice for analyzing this molecule? The key is to do quantitative analysis down to 10 Pika grams from L from human serum. And so if you\u0026rsquo;re the analysts being brought this problem of this challenge, would you choose or should you choose APCI? To do this, the things you should be doing is looking at this molecule for Is there a place to ionize a place to put a proton? The answer is yes. There\u0026rsquo;s an oxygen there. oxygens here, two oxygens here, there\u0026rsquo;s a nitrogen here. This is an Amad. So yes, it should have proton affinity. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly nonpolar. I see the sidechain out here. We know that APCI is a good technique for nonpolar compounds. In fact, the sample preparation to isolate this from human serum was a simple extract with hexane. So this is a good candidate for APCI there, but there is one important gotcha on this why APCI may not be the proper optimal choice. And that\u0026rsquo;s this four membered [lacto??] ring. If we protonate this molecule under APCI, with the heat associated with a PCI, we do remember that most should remember that a PCI is a very mild ionization technique, fragmentation generally does not occur as a result of the ionization. However, it does use heat to thermally vaporize this molecule and heat when this is protonated. This strain ring four membered ring is going to be labile and readily open. In fact, the ring open version is a hydroxy compound. And that\u0026rsquo;s actually a metabolite of this molecule in the human. And so because of this lactone ring, this is not tech a PCR is not a good technique or choice technique for this. And in fact, 1000s of samples were analyzed successfully by electrospray LCMS of this molecule and not APCI. So that\u0026rsquo;s an important feature to appreciate with APCI and that is that the heat can thermally degrade thermally labile molecules such as this,\n2C Questions\nwe come to the questions at the end of this lecture like to see:\n does APCI depend upon solution phase or gas phase chemistry to form its ions? It depends upon gas phase chemistry, your analyte must be able to be volatize in the hot vapor in the region of the corona discharge needle and not decompose. And so doing question two, what are the favorable mobile phase flow rate conditions for APCI LCMS. As indicated earlier, a half mil to as much as two mils per minute mobile phase can be tolerated. A happy medium is a neighborhood of one mil per minute, What actually initiates the formation of ions and APCI LCMS. The discharge needle ionizes nitrogen through a dot plus the nitrogen interacts with water to form H three O plus the bronze that acid and that species as a proton donor to your molecules one of the actual ionization species that cause your airlines to be come ionized and APCI LCMS. That\u0026rsquo;s the points that I just made, meaning the nitrogen and the water being formed into hydronium ion. Why is the term proton affinity relevant to APCI and proton affinity of what is the proton affinity of your molecule, it\u0026rsquo;s the DS it\u0026rsquo;s the affinity of your molecule or some portion of the molecules such as a hetero atom, nitrogen being one of the atoms with the highest proton affinity, your molecule must want and be able to accept and accommodate a proton, and that as a function of the proton affinity of the elements in your molecule. Why APCI LCMS experiments are relatively easy to do. There are minimum variables things that you have to adjust and change it simply simpler to do. And finally, what heat issues are important to bear in mind with regard to APCI LCMS experiments, the heat of the vaporizer and the effort and the process of vaporizing your analyte there\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot of heat in that vapor and if your molecule is thermally labile then that heat can cause it to fragment or break and I showed a good example with a molecule THL which had the beta lactam strain ring for membered lactone.  That brings us to the final end of this lecture and here a reference references published publications that are relevant to the points I\u0026rsquo;ve just covered in this lecture.\n"},{"id":131,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Advion-Courses/Lecture-03/","title":"Lecture 3 - Sample Preparation, Ion Source Optimization \u0026 ASAP Probe","section":"Advion Courses on LC-MS","content":"Ion source parameters that can be optimized are:\n Capillary temperature Capillary voltage Source voltage offset  Sample Preparation #  Let\u0026rsquo;s continue then with lecture three, which is sample preparation.\nSomething no one likes to do, but is really important, the best results come from good sample preparation. And first you need to define the sample. There\u0026rsquo;s many different types and is each type, but it\u0026rsquo;s urine plasma soil. Lots of other matrices may or may not require very different approach. The goal is to do as little as possible just enough to get good results. I would like to suggest that one of the reasons LC ms ms has become so popular is that it actually diminished the amount of sample preparation needed to do that the powerful combination of liquid chromatography with ms ms meant that the really dirty samples dirtier than ever before can be run, we have selected ion monitoring, not MSMS. And you\u0026rsquo;d be surprised at how successful you can be with a certain degree of selective sample preparation, selecting the analytes of interest to you from the matrix, we want to remove the matrix or diminish it and then pull out the analytes of interest and so LCMS can be very powerful, more so than LC UV or GC fid. These other techniques. So the sample types, there are laboratories that I gotta fix this again. reaction mixture synthetic chemists make all kinds of Rick reaction mixtures sometimes the compositions pretty nasty for direct injection. In pharmaceutical industry, that\u0026rsquo;s where new drugs come from other than other than natural products as chemists make new and sees new chemical entities which if they prove out they become a drug. Flash chromatography I mentioned before for preoperative that\u0026rsquo;s for our our colleagues working on the roof. Don\u0026rsquo;t don\u0026rsquo;t get seasick. The good news is what we\u0026rsquo;re filming, it will be steady, hopefully, dissolved solids, prep LLC samples. We\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about thinner chromatography technology from the 30s 1930s that people still people still use, certainly environmental samples and we have a lot of experience in biological samples, namely plasma, urine, CSF and tissue and so forth. Many kinds of samples that are now amenable to LCMS. The goals or objectives of solvent extraction is isolate the desired chemicals of interest to remove as many as possible the contaminants to keep the analyte and solution and by the way, not decompose it as we go. Sometimes you can hydrolyze them or decompose them. So to preserve the analyte and to concentrate it down a middle leader, a mil a nanogram per milliliter, if you can concentrate that down into 200 microliters. Now you\u0026rsquo;ve got enough to readily see, some sometimes directly injecting urine or plasma doesn\u0026rsquo;t work very well, because it\u0026rsquo;s too diluted, you got all those matrix components, the sample preparation preparation is really important to the really simple techniques that are available or dilution. Remember, I mentioned that solution to pollution is dilution. To avoid overwhelmingly contaminating the mass spectrometer, it is very sensitive and more is not better. In many cases, filtration or centrifugation can remove particulates. And that\u0026rsquo;s important because they can cause problems we have a lot of small inside diameter tubings we have Fritz and capillaries and they can become restricted or plugged and sometimes very difficult to open up. dissolving and neutralization of the sample is important to make less basic or acidic. And then in other words to control the pH and salts. So urine has a lot of salts. cerebral spinal fluid has a lot of salts, organic salts, and the salts are polar molecules. And if they come through on electrospray, at the same time, it suppresses the daylights out of the signal of your analyte. And in preoperative TLC prep with thin layer chromatography, I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine us moving that much. But it is you know, we ought to bring that down amount of that table. Got to just have to bear with it. We were supposed to be finished with a roof on Friday, but that\u0026rsquo;s not going to help us dilution the preferred quantity to introduce or inject into the system is about 10 to 50 nanograms, the actual amount injected, now not 50 nanograms per mil, but the in the syringe or in the audit sampler. That amount is plenty and more organic chemists don\u0026rsquo;t even know to with all due respect what a nanogram is they\u0026rsquo;re used to milligrams and grams. And so it\u0026rsquo;s really common to have them add inject way too much sample you have to teach them. recipe on how to dilute it. 10s of micrograms is way too much. A sample with a concentration of wealth milligrams per mil should be diluted by at least 10,000 fold. So you take a tiny little bit and added a sufficient solvent to give it that kind of a dilution. 10 microliters of such a sample dissolved in 100 mils would then give you such a sample. And if you\u0026rsquo;re serving organic chemists and people are unfamiliar with doing this sort of thing, you simply need to give them some breath a recipe and guidance on how to do that. And as they learn, they\u0026rsquo;ll they\u0026rsquo;ll follow that as their their new norm. But their existing norm is taking it directly from a class that maybe is making 100 milligrams, or a gram. And that\u0026rsquo;s a really concentrated sample more than we can nearly tolerate. So filtration and centrifugation can remove particulate solids, if you will. And they will clog the LC, mainly the Fritz, most columns have a fret of the inlet and the and the exit. And sometimes there\u0026rsquo;d be so much in the column that it actually restricts the particulates. injected samples should be free of particulates. And so if you center you to something you can\u0026rsquo;t offer, you aspirate off, you don\u0026rsquo;t let the needle go to the bottom, because that\u0026rsquo;s where the pilot solids are. A lot of this is such common sense. But some people don\u0026rsquo;t recognize these things. If you sent a few as a sample, you don\u0026rsquo;t put a syringe needle in right into the bottom of the tube, you go above that, so that the particles are not aspirated up can use a syringe adoptables filters, that\u0026rsquo;s okay if you have just a few samples. But sometimes we have hundreds of samples, we often use 96 Well plates, four of them on a auto sampler at one time. And there are plates that can have a fret, and every well and you can spin those. But in general filtering is is a high workflow and not used by too many folks, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes easier to use centrifugation spent an aliquot for five minutes on a laboratory centrifuge 3000 rpm, and D carefully can\u0026rsquo;t be can\u0026rsquo;t or remove an aliquot from the supernatant. Oftentimes this is done with a robot if you\u0026rsquo;re running lots of samples, it comes down in this program to not go to the bottom of the well. Everything like even making sure the plate is level in its position, not tilt it up somehow, because then the needle will go down and aspirate up the particles as well as bend the needle. Lots of ways to go wrong, but it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to avoid it. Dissolving or neutralization inorganic ions salts are not good for these for electrospray. In fact, I would never want you to run any sodium or potassium salt of anything, because it\u0026rsquo;ll be in your system. If you run it all weekend just kind of purging with methanol water, you will still have potassium in there on Monday morning. potassium and sodium is liberally leached from the glass bottles that your solvents are in your aqueous solvents. We electrospray is incredibly sensitive to potassium or sodium attics, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much at all of much of a concentration all in the aqueous solvent to have those ions add duct to your molecule. People say I didn\u0026rsquo;t put anything in there. No you did, but it came from the bottle. Even changing the mobile face bottles daily is a good idea. If water sits in the same bottle all week long, it has more time to leach out but sodium, potassium and sodium. So it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to use small enough time. So at the end of the day or overnight, you\u0026rsquo;ve used much of it not all of it, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to run out in the middle of the night, and then you make a fresh batch. There\u0026rsquo;s other reasons, good reasons for making fresh daily samples. If you have ammonium hydroxide as an additive to control pH that\u0026rsquo;s extremely volatile. If you leave it in the bottle by the way and you\u0026rsquo;re near the window with the sunlight coming in like some sometimes happen. The ammonium hydroxide evaporates out and by the later in the week, you don\u0026rsquo;t have anywhere near as much ammonium hydroxide there your retention times will change your sensitivity would change all because your mobile phase composition of ammonium hydroxide has changed due to evaporation. Neutralization with volatile acids or bases may be appropriate. And these are listed here. As I mentioned earlier, these are what we call LCMS friendly additives acetic acid ammonium hydroxide formic acid. It was a quick glimpse reminder of flame filling thin layer chromatography. Historically, in our resource drug testing days, we screened a race with TLC you have a 10 by 10 plate. And usually there\u0026rsquo;s eight or 10 horses in a race and you could put a whole horse race on one plate and you could watch the horses race outside or you get to watch their urine race up the TLC plate and you would scrape those spots and extract them with methanol, which extracts which dissolve silica by the way, we\u0026rsquo;re going to show you a much easier, better automated way to do TLC ms than that later on this afternoon. But historically, played spots would be scraped eluted with solvent and injected into the oil CMS or GCMs, sometimes liquid solid extraction for extracting chemicals from solid samples like extraction of soil. So, these are various approaches to sample preparation, homogenization of soil or tissue drying it. To get an accurate weight of dry wait you need to dry up way it sample it historically, as a soxhlet extraction has been done, which is very difficult to automate and very uses high levels, volumes of solvents and as environmentally unfriendly, more modern techniques such as accelerated solvent extraction has been commercialized by Dionic commercializes some time ago, as well as the iyonix is one of the first to do supercritical fluid extraction that\u0026rsquo;s now been acquired by other companies. This can be automated and gives you good selectivity depending upon the nature of your molecule. So there is a good old fashioned separatory funnel. I know, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if anyone\u0026rsquo;s still doing that. But there probably are some, if you have high numbers of samples, that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty tedious way to do it. There are miniaturized ways of doing that. And that means liquid liquid extraction, two layers, immiscible layers of solvents where the sample is in one, and you\u0026rsquo;re trying to transfer be at the interface of the immiscible solids into the other layer. And lights, of course, can be nonpolar, polar, or ionic. And you need to bear that in mind as to what solvents you\u0026rsquo;re trying to extract your analytes into extraction, solvent polarity and selectivity isn\u0026rsquo;t is important. You carefully choose these to optimize recovering what you want, versus not recovering what you don\u0026rsquo;t want. Volume, size and extrapolate sample size. This has been a compelling change from the past, and my race horse drug testing days, partly because horses have a lot of urine, volumes of urine. And partly because technology wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good, we would typically analyze 99 milliliters of blood, you\u0026rsquo;d centrifuge out and get four or five mils of plasma. And you\u0026rsquo;d compare that middle litres of biological sample to what I described this morning for newborn screening, where you\u0026rsquo;re putting 20 microliters of blood onto a dried blood spot. So micro sampling is invoked now, we\u0026rsquo;re looking at much smaller samples and volumes of samples. And that\u0026rsquo;s because by using less, you have less analyzed, but you also will have less matrix to deal with. And the instruments are so sensitive and so selected that we can actually do this. And so the trend is towards smaller and smaller samples. The meeting I was at recently, again, was on micro sampling, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of quite a trend and doing that. Y\u0026rsquo;all we\u0026rsquo;re always interested in recovery, the EPA has an insists upon the recovery of at least 70% bio, the bio analytical community, a pharmaceutical industry doesn\u0026rsquo;t care what the percentage is as long as it\u0026rsquo;s reproducible across the concentration range of the analytes. Oftentimes, if you use liquid liquid extraction, you have to have a blowdown step, which means you have a volatile solvent and test tubes or a multiwall rack and you put it in the hood under a gentle stream of nitrogen, maybe a little bit of heat and you have your aerosol off or your volatilize off the solvent, methanol or some volatile solvent. The challenge with that is if you let the sample go to dryness, you\u0026rsquo;re going to actually aerosol, your sample out of the test tube, depending on what those compounds are. If they\u0026rsquo;re hydrochloride salts, that works quite nicely. You inject that sample after reconstituted you don\u0026rsquo;t see anything, because you blew it off in the hood. So this technique involved in all these being aware of what can go wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s not rocket scientist common sense. But just going through without thinking about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is is risky, you\u0026rsquo;ll have troubles. So the inner introduction to extraction. Here\u0026rsquo;s another example perfect picture of a separatory funnel. We don\u0026rsquo;t use separatory funnels, we have little multiwall plates. It\u0026rsquo;s a miniature test tube, if you will. And so you have an aqueous solvent, if it\u0026rsquo;s urine or plasma that\u0026rsquo;s aqueous you have an organic solvent, common solvents or ethyl acetate immiscible with aqueous and butyl chloride immiscible. dichloromethane is a series of solvents that are often used that people favor and you shake these in this case of the separate tote funny you literally shake it. But in the miniaturized version, you put it on a vortex mixer and multi well plate mix it like that you may if you\u0026rsquo;re into test tubes, you may put on a rotor rack carefully Stoppard and tube and you rotate that for 20 minutes or something to mix the solvents. When you stop doing that and put them in a centrifuge then you separate the layers and if you\u0026rsquo;re smart, or can you will choose a solvent This is which is lighter than water, the aqueous layer so it\u0026rsquo;s on top. And when it comes to allocating off you\u0026rsquo;re going aliquot directly. If that\u0026rsquo;s not The case if you\u0026rsquo;re using chloroform, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be below the what the aqueous layer. So aspirate off the lake was layer and then go to get the other one all common tricks that people familiar with this approach No. So at the end, you have two layers and the analytes of interest are hopefully in one of the layers, the non aqueous layer that you might want. solid phase extraction SPE is an alternative to liquid liquid extraction. This is amenable to polarities across the range from ionic polar, nonpolar, solid phase extraction stationary phase, it\u0026rsquo;s chromate. It\u0026rsquo;s liquid chromatography. And in a crude way, it\u0026rsquo;s particles of silica, they\u0026rsquo;re usually much larger particles 30 to 50 microns, modern day columns are minimally three micron size, and UHPLC particles are 1.7 microns. So very small particles, solid phase extraction cartridges or multi well plates, the particles are at our at least, the smallest CR is 10 microns, usually, and often 30 or 40 microns, so they\u0026rsquo;re more porous. So we\u0026rsquo;re not looking for high selectivity, or for Well, we\u0026rsquo;d like to have higher selectivity, but that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to have high separation efficiency in a SBE format. So solid phase extraction is a crude, simple version of conventional liquid chromatography. In a column, we we generally determine the recovery of the analyte like to get as much as possible. [16:52] But I always felt and taught that if even if I had only 30% recovery, if it was clean, it was really selective, I\u0026rsquo;ve got the sensitivity to see that I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to remove a lot of my matrix this is getting in a way. And there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with 30%. Recovery healthy, it\u0026rsquo;s been rather low, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s the same 30% at my lower limit of quantitation. The bottom of the calibration curve, as it is at the top, most of the time it will be sometimes it will not be conventional cartridges, there are individual cartridges you can get versus a 96. Well format. 96 is a array of wells in a plastic disposable plate, there are even 384 well plates, but not too many people have that many samples or use those. It\u0026rsquo;s amenable to it but most people don\u0026rsquo;t have the samples, there\u0026rsquo;s a range of bed sizes a very small bed, that\u0026rsquo;s the amount of packing that\u0026rsquo;s in the in the well, is maybe 10 milligrams, it can be 100 milligrams to 250 milligrams, that your choice of the bed size is a function of the capacity that you need, are you going to put on a milliliter of your sample, or you\u0026rsquo;re going to put on 100 microliters, or even 50 microliters. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to only put on a 50 microliters of urine than you need, you don\u0026rsquo;t need a large bed size, you need fit 10 milligrams or less. In fact, putting in a very small volume, let\u0026rsquo;s say a urine 50 microliters into a 500 milligram bed, you will leave lose a lot of your anolyte to silica surfaces on that extra bed is all this extra bed that you don\u0026rsquo;t need. And you\u0026rsquo;re going to lose sample to that. There are still the majority of the SPE cartridges are silica. But there are also polymer base supports they\u0026rsquo;re literally styrene dye Ventile benzene sort of polymers that are functionalized, there is offline versus online offline is you manually taking up a test tube, or a part cartridge or a multi well plate from one station to the next you take it to the from the extraction to the centrifugation to the robot to blowing it down though you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re the robot, if you will, taking it from station to station. There are commercial systems available for online solid phase extraction. And one of those was called a prospect. I have a lot of experience with that it\u0026rsquo;s made by a Dutch company called spark Holland and the Netherlands. And that will do total automated online SPE hands off is put you put urine or plasma in the autosampler. And it gives you the result at the end. It works. It\u0026rsquo;s quite robust and reliable. The downside is throughput and sample throughput. you\u0026rsquo;re tying up a good expensive mass spectrometer while this extraction is being done. It\u0026rsquo;s so the cycle time between sample one and sample two, or sample 9495 is much longer than if you have your samples already prepared in 96 well plate, it might be two seconds cycle time for pre prepared samples versus five or six minute cycle time if you\u0026rsquo;re using a system and that\u0026rsquo;s what we use. That\u0026rsquo;s not important if you don\u0026rsquo;t have 1000s of samples, but if you have 1000s of samples that takes a long time. And finally, if you were if you do an sp with a final illusion of the cartridge with a solvent, you probably have a biome that\u0026rsquo;s too large, you\u0026rsquo;d like to concentrate that down. So once again, like liquid liquid extraction, you need to do a blowdown step in reconstitute, take it down to near dryness and bring it back up and what solvent, ideally, the the mobile phase that you\u0026rsquo;re using for LCMS. If you bring it up, take it up, reconstitute it and 1% methanol, what will happen, your gradient is going to be at 20 80%, water 20% methanol, beginning of the gradient is mostly water, you\u0026rsquo;re injecting 20 microliters of methanol solution, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a split LCP, because 100% methanol on your column is a very strong solid, you\u0026rsquo;re going to gradient to get that methanol towards the end. But what happens when you reconstitute in strong solid, like really good solid like methanol, it\u0026rsquo;ll give you a split, LCP and people using UV Dawn never know the difference, but we can tell the difference. So each of those peaks is the same compound. So ideally, you want your sample to be reconstituted in the mobile phase or something close to what the mobile phase is. Gel know that. A lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t. So the steps and solid phase extraction, sample pretreatment, perhaps pH adjustment, based upon the stationary phase and the chemistry using column weddings, column consolidation, the packing in the column is dry, you need to condition it by wedding it generally with methanol, it actually swells us most of the time, it\u0026rsquo;s organic solvents like methanol or Sina trail. So you wet it, and then you often will treat it with water that\u0026rsquo;s already swelled, you want to get rid of that methanol, because your sample going on will not trap your analytes. If it\u0026rsquo;s in the presence of a strong solvent like methanol, so you wet it with water, you calibrate it, you apply the sample by a with a given volume. And usually it\u0026rsquo;s not a large volume. This technique is fairly miniaturize, if it\u0026rsquo;s a multi wall plate, it might be 50 microliters, that you\u0026rsquo;re adding to to the each well, if it\u0026rsquo;s one of these cartridges that might be a middle liter or more depends on on your scale, you apply the sample, and then you do success of additional solvents to elute. What you don\u0026rsquo;t want your One strategy is to retain what you want, have it stay on the column as you successfully wash off the interferences the endogenous compounds. And then the final step is you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten rid of Hopefully, most of the waste things you don\u0026rsquo;t want. Now you we loot into a separate clean container what you want. And that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re going to inject and LCMS. Here\u0026rsquo;s a cartoon from way back. That process the column conditioning, this is shown a typical cartridge, which are commercially available. But the same applies to whether it\u0026rsquo;s a miniaturized version and a 96 full plate. Do any of you use Mali wall plates don\u0026rsquo;t have enough samples to justify it, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. It\u0026rsquo;s only when you have lots of samples that you do that. It\u0026rsquo;s an array of limiter test tubes. So comic calibration, apply the sample, and then interference dilution. So the band of original samples here, the analytes are there, they\u0026rsquo;re moving down, but the waste, the things you don\u0026rsquo;t want are hopefully eluding and you\u0026rsquo;re discarding them or setting them aside. That\u0026rsquo;s not what you want in your sample. And finally, you have a step where you use a solvent that\u0026rsquo;s strong enough to elude the analytes of interest. If you\u0026rsquo;re really smart and lucky, there will still be some highly retained things on here like phospho lipids, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want them in your sample. Those are those those eggs have existed forever. But within the last 10 or 15 years that we really realize how bad they were for what we were doing. They\u0026rsquo;re very nonpolar, they\u0026rsquo;re highly retained. And they would often often come out late in the chromatogram. Sometime they\u0026rsquo;ve come off so late that they didn\u0026rsquo;t see him until the next injection, they\u0026rsquo;re still in the column, you stop, you reset, you re cycled your column back to the original gradient, you have now make another injection. And somewhere in that chromatogram comes off what was in the first injection can be very confusing. And so it\u0026rsquo;s possible, if you are smart, is this, the solvent that you use here is strong enough to elude what you want, but not strong enough to elute possible lipids, what a lot of people do to speed things up. This last step is 100% methanol, which washes off what they want, and the phospholipids. And so they lose out because they\u0026rsquo;re not fully benefiting from smart SP. So that\u0026rsquo;s something to be aware of. So solid phase extraction summary. The positives are it\u0026rsquo;s easy to automate, means you can have a life after five o\u0026rsquo;clock, so amenable to these multiwall formats. It is environmentally friendly, that we\u0026rsquo;re not using 50 to 100 milliliters of solvent and a separatory funnel. We\u0026rsquo;re using 10s of microliters, maybe 100 microliters, much lower volume. It\u0026rsquo;s amenable to minimum sample quantities, we can scale down. What\u0026rsquo;s the other side of the coin negatives extracts are not necessarily as clean. Generally there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of publications and in my own experience, it may be possible to get an SPE extract is clean is liquid liquid, but you have to try a lot of experiments is really empirically to systematically try these different elution solvents. So, the extracts are generally not as clean selectivity may be limited based upon the stationary phase in the cartridge that you use. And this is a part that used to bother us a lot, it\u0026rsquo;s better now, the quality of products are improved by us to get fines, fines or micro dust, micro particulates of silica would come through the cartridge and be in the test tube or in the wall, the wall plate and plug up our, our LCMS system. So, you\u0026rsquo;re having sampled go through cartridge particles, and some of those particles have not been sieved. If you will carefully enough, there\u0026rsquo;s some super fine stuff and winds up in your sample. This can cause clogging column pressure build up something to watch for the column pressure system. If the pressure is increasing, and continues to increase and later shuts off your pump, because it\u0026rsquo;s reached a maximum, you need to discover sleuth out what\u0026rsquo;s really happening, a somewhat recent product from biotop. And by the way, mentioning a products other than our own, is we\u0026rsquo;re users just like everybody else, I\u0026rsquo;m not endorsing them or trying to sell them to you. But this is an interesting product from biotage. It\u0026rsquo;s called ISO Lotus calls SLE supported liquid extraction, think of it as liquid liquid extraction as at the interface of a particle diatomaceous earth is the particle and as a monolayer of liquid on the surface. And by using this approach, there\u0026rsquo;s a form of liquid liquid extraction on a microscopic scale between the solvent going through the cartridge and the liquid on the surface of the particles. And it turns out, this is very easy. The workflow involves having a cup of coffee, you apply the aqueous sample to the cartridge and you go away for five minutes, have a cup of coffee or check your email, you come back and step three and add organic solvent and allude we have a lot of experience I do with this. And this is quite effective for certain applications that universal is turns out to be very effective at removing or retaining those fossil lipids, they stay on the cartridge, so they\u0026rsquo;re cleaner. And so here\u0026rsquo;s an example with steroids. Here\u0026rsquo;s the same time clock and you can read through the sequence here on your own. But here are a series of steroids that are all very similar. And what I\u0026rsquo;m amazed that\u0026rsquo;ll show in a moment is the recovery. It\u0026rsquo;s almost too good to be true. So here is the procedure. Again, I will not go through it in detail sample may human plasma 100 microliters, that\u0026rsquo;s about three drops four drops of blood as opposed to milliliters. You go to the phlebotomist now for blood tests, and they collect four or five mils of blood. I want to have this done. I say, Have you folks heard of dried blood spots yet, and of course they haven\u0026rsquo;t. Now that\u0026rsquo;s a doctor\u0026rsquo;s office, they don\u0026rsquo;t do that. And the merchants in the hospital where the babies are born, they do but I think that\u0026rsquo;ll come in time. But very few people are using micro sampling in our real world. Usually a card has multiple spots, and you can send one spot for this test the other spot for another test, you can do lots of different things. So this is a impressive plot. This, these are a whole slew of different steroids. And this is the recovery. It\u0026rsquo;s essentially quantitative recovery, I mentioned 30%. Being okay, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s reproducible. I mentioned 70% The EPA requires so for these steroids under these conditions, they\u0026rsquo;re having greater than 90% recovery for almost all of these almost 100%. That\u0026rsquo;s fairly impressive. So SLE if some of you who have not tried these and are have compounds and samples, similar to this, you might take a look. So references for this are here for your reference to relates to what I\u0026rsquo;ve described.\nIon Source Optimization #  [28:53] So Ion Source optimization, this is not a big deal. It\u0026rsquo;s I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to think you can\u0026rsquo;t get results unless you do this. But if you want optimal results, that\u0026rsquo;s why the word optimization, it\u0026rsquo;ll work on a wide variety of conditions. But for optimum sensitivity, which it sounds like many of you some of you are not concerned with, you\u0026rsquo;ve got plenty of sample, you folks may be interested at times and optimizing to get the most out of the system and optimizing this tuning and source conditions can definitely buy you quite a lot increase sensitivity. So here\u0026rsquo;s an example of Terfenadine and positive ion electrospray. So reminder what our system is we\u0026rsquo;re spraying up here, usually at an angle, and droplets are in the spray ions ion evaporation takes place. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing electrospray and the ions come down, they make a turn, go through the ion optics and to the quadripolar detected. But I\u0026rsquo;m going to be talking about the capillary voltage, the source voltage offset that all this is about source optimization. So there\u0026rsquo;s two or three voltages that are important that help optimize your sensitivity. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about these regions when I talk about the capillary.\nStep one concentrations five nanograms per microliter solvent is shown here, methanol, water, mostly methanol flow rate, 300 microliters per minute, and our electrospray positive ion source and the same ion source setting. And here\u0026rsquo;s the summary of the conditions there.\nStep three, create an MS method, you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing this in laboratory this afternoon, through this template, if you will, a reminder what the drug is, and I would think, chemistry think and if you\u0026rsquo;re targeting a molecule, you know what the molecular weight is, first thing you\u0026rsquo;re looking forward is the appropriate n plus one is a vast where you expected to be assuming it\u0026rsquo;s targeted analysis. And so there\u0026rsquo;s normal setup here is a scanning from 100 to 700, scan time, and so forth, those those conditions. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about optimizing some of these parameters.\nStep four, start the acquisition, make sure the acquisition time the runtime is long enough. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to use it for 10 minutes, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to you don\u0026rsquo;t want to set it up for five minutes, it\u0026rsquo;ll stop just about the time it gets interesting, self evident. Go to the ion source tab and open the ion source file saved in step one, and the line source setting will be active and can be changed, it\u0026rsquo;ll be real time. And\nStep six is three parameters are important source offset voltage, capillary temperature, the heated Kappeler, where the ions, ions enter in the first place, and the capillary voltage, they easily optimize in these following slides.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s a series is this I missing something right there at lunch, it was there. And now it\u0026rsquo;s not there. I don\u0026rsquo;t sorry about that. You can refer to your drawing, if you have the drawing, for some reason I do not. So I show an arrow pointing down to where that schematic the cap, the source voltage often said is, so these are a series of repetitive injections. In each type. I alluded to this this morning, where you make an injection, you see how high it is, you make a change, you increase the voltage or decrease the voltage and you see whether the signal gets better. In this case, each time it\u0026rsquo;s increased up to a number 34, if you will, that seems to be optimizing, and further optimizing that voltage causes a reduction in sensitivity. So there\u0026rsquo;s the bell goes off, this is the setting of this, I have the source voltage offset that you should be using to get that sensitivity. That\u0026rsquo;s about doubling the sensitivity, again, would you take a double of your salary when you get home, it\u0026rsquo;s not a con inconsequential number, it\u0026rsquo;s good that double the sensitivity of the system. So that\u0026rsquo;s what that can do. And that can be done robotically with a autosampler, it\u0026rsquo;s the best way, or it can be done manually, which is a little more tedious.\nSlide: Effect of Capillary Temperature #  In this case, we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the capillary temperature, the heating of the capillary, we\u0026rsquo;re starting out quite low, and we\u0026rsquo;re moving up to 280 degrees. And that\u0026rsquo;s not doubling this may be 50% improvement in sensitivity in doing that. Now this is going to be a function of your molecule and to some degree, but more importantly, how much water you have in your spray solvent. This would be require a higher temperature, if you have 90% aqueous, it would require a smaller lower temperature by 30 or 40 degrees, perhaps if you had a high methanol. So the reason these might be varied will be a function of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. And with experience, you\u0026rsquo;ll know right what to set these out based on your prior experience. And so again, down here in your manual, there is an inset showing where that capillary temperature is.\nSlide: Effect of Capillary Voltage #  And finally varying the capillary voltage, the voltage on that capillary is not making much change here, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter as long as somewhere in the settings is no improvement or decrease in response. By varying that in this instance, that will not always be the case. But in this instance, that\u0026rsquo;s the case. So capillary voltage changes, do not showing the obvious impact on the SIM. This is a selected ion monitor monitoring selected when it could be done with total ion.\nSlide: Optimized Setting for Terfenadine #  So the starting point had these parameters. And the capillary temperature was 100. But we found out that it worked better 280, the capillary voltage was 100, we elevated it to 150. And the source voltage was 15. We moved it to 34. Those changes gave a noticeable improvement and sensitivity, not 100 fold not tenfold. Rarely will it be that much. But it can definitely be two or three or four fold, depending on what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. All the other parameters are left the same.\nSlide: What Source Voltage Span is for? #  Again, what source voltage what is source voltage span? And what\u0026rsquo;s it used for? In this case, we\u0026rsquo;ve got this parameter right here. And it means that with a source voltage offset of 15, and a span of zero, that we\u0026rsquo;re across the scan, we\u0026rsquo;re scanning the mass spectrometer from 100 or 10 to 2000. And nothing\u0026rsquo;s changing and the signals going to be the same way that cost there. If we have the span on it\u0026rsquo;s going to ramp this voltage up accordingly, across the scan each and every scan is going to ramp it back to zero ramping, every scan will be ramped up. And because met higher masses are heavier, more difficult, more challenging to focus, this can be a beneficial thing for especially high mass molecules. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking below mass-to-charge 350 400, this probably will not make too much difference. But if you\u0026rsquo;re looking at peptides or higher mass species, this can make a big difference, because you may have them fall off and not get quantitatively or efficiently to the detector. So I\u0026rsquo;m not going to not talk about LCMS. This is another kind of sample inlet system. That does not include liquid chromatography is an alternative that\u0026rsquo;s available on our system.\nSlide: Atmospheric Solids Analysis Probe (ASAP) #  It\u0026rsquo;s called the atmospheric solids analysis probe. And it was developed by a colleague, a friend of mine at DuPont, his name is Chuck McEwen and Barbara Larson. And as a patent that we have licensed, and it\u0026rsquo;s a way of it will, if you saw the meth lab video, that was a setup that we did there sticking a sample probe into a sample into a powder or liquid and sticking it in the mass spectrometer and you get a mass spectrum. If it\u0026rsquo;s multiple compounds on there, you get a mixed mass spectrum is like your fingerprint and my fingerprint, your fingerprint overlaid. So obviously going to mix mass spectrum because there\u0026rsquo;s no chromatography as it suggests this analysis a solid materials in API mass spectrometers, but I could add that if you have a solution, you dip it in and the solvent evaporates. Now you\u0026rsquo;ve got a solid sample, that solid was in solution. And now it\u0026rsquo;s on the probe. And by the way, the curl probe is a high price device called a melting point capillary, you can buy 100 of them for $10. We don\u0026rsquo;t use them for melting points, and we don\u0026rsquo;t put the sample in the tube, we put the sample on the outside of the closed end of the two. So it\u0026rsquo;s just a glass surface, it\u0026rsquo;s clean and enter, that the sample is on. And we stick that under hot nitrogen, which thermally dissolves it off. And we do mass spectrometry I\u0026rsquo;ll show you the deal details in a minute. By inserting a melting point glass tube into the stream of hot nitrogen gas, the solid is thermally desorb or evaporated, assuming it can be desorb. This is not amenable not amenable to multiple proteins or peptides, it\u0026rsquo;s for small molecules, not really small, but under 1000. If you would say molecular weight, evaporated from the tube surface and then ionized at atmospheric pressure by the corona discharge of an IP API source, the hot gas stream usually 350 to 500 seats, so it is hot, is provided by the APCI heated nebulizer probe that we typically have. What\u0026rsquo;s important to take away from this, I explained APCI in the presence of Saddam, there is no solvent, here. Solvent was the source of the water, or the acid or so forth, and LCMS. Whereas the source of the proton here, we\u0026rsquo;ll see. It shows a protonated molecule. So it\u0026rsquo;s really important to note that this is APCI in the absence of solvent, which gives it some special beneficial characteristics.\nSlide: Schematic of ASAP Probe in CMS #  So here\u0026rsquo;s a picture of what I just described. Here\u0026rsquo;s the probe it\u0026rsquo;s a glass capillary, this is not as an older drawing. This is the standard. He didn\u0026rsquo;t have nebulizer coming in. But normally we have liquid coming in here. But now we have just hot gas, no liquids has actually kept off. It\u0026rsquo;s just a source of hot nitrogen plus the corona discharge to do the ionization the same mechanism I showed before. So the samples on here, it\u0026rsquo;s got a built in stop, you can\u0026rsquo;t push it too far. And it has been dipped into sample and it\u0026rsquo;s thermally desorbed, ionized and goes into the mass spectrometer inlet. This shows a photograph of the capsular it\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to see. But right at the the opening of the hot cast from the APCI Pro.\nSlide #  This is an early version. I\u0026rsquo;m a very impatient person I get we get an idea. And I like to do it right now we have our own machine shop have gone makes many of its own things. Nothing here is made in China. So to Trump, Trump\u0026rsquo;s hopefully can\u0026rsquo;t bother us. So I went home and made this in my basement. Because I can do that. We now have a nice one down here. This one\u0026rsquo;s not so pretty, but it worked. But the one we have now that you\u0026rsquo;ll use this afternoon is this one down here that\u0026rsquo;s much more pretty. And so that\u0026rsquo;s the probe that\u0026rsquo;s inserts into that hole right through the front of this, and it\u0026rsquo;s really easy to do, but it\u0026rsquo;s not LCMS.\nSlide #  So here\u0026rsquo;s a video of Shang Tong using a system some time back, dipping into a reaction mixture. So this is amenable to perhaps in certain instances with synthetic organic chemists. It\u0026rsquo;s been dipped in a sample it\u0026rsquo;s put into the source. There\u0026rsquo;s the hit, there is the needle. The hot gas comes through that hole and has shown in the month of meth lab drug bust outcomes a sample the ion current profile that\u0026rsquo;s not occurring Mata gram that\u0026rsquo;s an ion current profile, there is a mass spectrum. If you\u0026rsquo;re impatient like me, you get instant results in seconds, you get a mass spectrum, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for it to come off the column. So that\u0026rsquo;s a video of that.\nSlide #  The new probe looks like this. Here\u0026rsquo;s a pill like a ibuprofen of some sort, you either scrape or just touch the pill. In fact, the rule of thumb, if you can see sample on the probe on the glass is too much, we often scratch the pill, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll Kimwipe, wipe it off, you think it\u0026rsquo;d be all gone, there\u0026rsquo;s plenty left on there to get a mass spectrum. And so we typically scratch it or touch the pill. And if you can see the sample, it\u0026rsquo;s too much.\nSlide #  So here\u0026rsquo;s the positive ion ASAP. Hey, ASAP pennsburg solids analysis probe analysis of an acetaminophen tablet. That peak is the NADA chromatogram is the iron current profile coming out that\u0026rsquo;s a thermal desorption profile of the cinnamon coming off its molecular weight is 151. We see a 152 with its isotope and no fragmentation because it\u0026rsquo;s mild ionization. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing else seen there are excipients, inorganic excipients. And we don\u0026rsquo;t see those because they don\u0026rsquo;t volatilize. So anything that\u0026rsquo;s inorganic or inviolable, will not interfere because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t volatilize.\nSlide #  Here\u0026rsquo;s drug standards that we mentioned before series of drugs, widely varying, none of them particularly high molecular weight, highest one is about 434 rather challenging, challenging one.\nSlide #  And if you dip, though, that probe into that thing, you each each one of these is a single analysis, if you will, each one has a poke of the probe into the sample, you know, one of the standards and I don\u0026rsquo;t remember what this one is, I actually I think I did this one. I don\u0026rsquo;t don\u0026rsquo;t remember what it was was quite a while back. But you can easily get on a spectrum of these. It\u0026rsquo;s not urine, it\u0026rsquo;s not plasma, it\u0026rsquo;s not a dirty sample. It\u0026rsquo;s a relatively clean sample. If you want to know what the white powder is, it\u0026rsquo;s a quick way of learning that.\nSlide #  Here\u0026rsquo;s a synthesis, in the essence, organic synthesis, extract an iron current profile as a reaction mixture. Here\u0026rsquo;s the XIC, versus time, whose zero minutes, and after 120 minutes, you see the disappearance of the starting material and the onset of the reaction product. And that\u0026rsquo;s what synthetic chemists want to know. They think they know what they\u0026rsquo;re making. Once in a while the truth machine hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed their mind. They didn\u0026rsquo;t make what they thought they made. But they need to know that. Oftentimes, they\u0026rsquo;re trying to optimize the synthesis, sometimes they will need to know when to quit. In the old days, I started out as a synthetic organic chemists and my PhD program. And I use mass spectrometry to monitor what I was making. And I I I learned that I had more fun doing the mass spectrometry than the synthesis. So I went to the dark side analytical chemistry. But these folks are making these things. And they typically would put eight or 10 round bottom flask on the bench, they\u0026rsquo;d work all day long to hopefully get eight reactions going on to slightly different conditions by the end of the day. So they go home, they let a reflex all night. Well, sometimes those reactions were optimized at eight o\u0026rsquo;clock after three or four hours. And then the continued reflux would decompose what they made, they need to know when to stop, you need to know when the the optimum yield is there. And with this approach, you can do that sort of thing. Because you\u0026rsquo;re monitoring everything in the pot.\nSlide #  Here is a formation of 4-Iodoisoquinoline. If you remember your bromine chemistry, it\u0026rsquo;s got two abundant ions 79 And, and 81. So any bromine containing compound has a mass spectrum all abundant, two ions spaced by two daltons. And when you convert that to an iodine, which has no isotopes, you go from this mass spectrum to that one, pretty clear what you have and what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, very easy to do something like that.\nSlide #  Advantages of ASAP little or no sample preparation, many people like that. But remember, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be effective for a really complex sample, especially at trace levels. If there\u0026rsquo;s very low levels of something you\u0026rsquo;re interested in and a complex mixture, this probably won\u0026rsquo;t work unless you do some sample prep. You dip the capillary tube into the solution, let it dry, and the sample is ready. And depending on what the solvent is for the solution that can be used as just a few seconds. If it\u0026rsquo;s methanol, by the time you move it from here to there. It\u0026rsquo;s almost evaporated because you don\u0026rsquo;t have much on there. It\u0026rsquo;s a rapid determination of the desired reaction reaction product being produced. You monitor the reduction in starting materials, and you look for the maximum ratio of products to the starting materials. Its reduction in solvent use no solvents required as compared to else CMS RFI.\nSlide #  and references for that. I mentioned Charles McEwen and these folks that invented this. This is one of these three popular ambient ionization techniques. This is a CEP the other one is called Dessi, which was created in Graham Koch\u0026rsquo;s lab desorbed electrospray ionization that\u0026rsquo;s an Ambien idealization technique competitive with us. And the other one is called Dart direct analysis in real time. It\u0026rsquo;s an acronym for that. And all three of these techniques, do not use chromatography. Use a simple touch the sample and analyze by this technique, we offer just the ASAP. We\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the other techniques and have selected this one as the preferred one for our customers.\n"},{"id":132,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Advion-Courses/Lecture-04/","title":"Lecture 4 - Novel Sampling Techniques - Plate Express, Touch Express","section":"Advion Courses on LC-MS","content":"Part 4A #  Lecture for Part A and Part B, both done know, in a sour thin layer chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. This is the slide I showed before then layer chromatography has a plate, they usually a silica on a thin layer, you spot a sample or three samples the same or different ones at the origin, you dip the bottom into a solvent of developing solvent, as it\u0026rsquo;s called, that\u0026rsquo;s the mobile phase. And by capillary action usually cover this so that the environment stays moist with the solvents. And usually in five to 10 minutes, the developing solvent moves and separates the components in these spots into separated chemical species. That\u0026rsquo;s chromatography, thin layer chromatography. And it\u0026rsquo;s typically normal phase. Remember, I mentioned normal phase and reversed phase there is reversed phase DLC, predominantly though it\u0026rsquo;s been normal phase. So hexane isopropanol variety of simple solvents, a nonpolar solvent with a polar solvent in it. And so you get a separation such as this, you take the plate out carefully by grabbing the top and let it air dry something like this. And the question is, what are the spots, often the chemists will apply what he or she thinks is in that sample adjacent. This might be these are all the same spots in this case, but typically, you would spot a lane as it\u0026rsquo;s called, of an animal standard that you think where you think you know what it is. And you compare the RF, the difference in the migration of the plate, and that quote, identifies it. Well, this is really low performance chromatography, it\u0026rsquo;s far from a UHPLC. And it\u0026rsquo;s very possible to have two components not resolved. And they think they don\u0026rsquo;t, they think they\u0026rsquo;re right, and they\u0026rsquo;re not. So they need the truth machine. And many a time, they will analyze a spot and find out it\u0026rsquo;s not what they think it is that it\u0026rsquo;s really something else with the same RF if you will. And so we have developed a TLC ms device, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to scrape these spots, you can actually sample it directly, and put it into the mass spectrometer directly. It\u0026rsquo;s another form of flow injection analysis, the chromatography has been done offline TLC plate, we placed the plate in this device, it\u0026rsquo;ll show you in a moment, and elute directly the spot into the mass spectrometer. So here is what our unit is called the plate Express adjacent to the system, I think you\u0026rsquo;ll see this working, it\u0026rsquo;s got a infusion pump, that delivery pump below it, that delivers solvent through the spot, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna pass solvent through the spot directly to the mass spectrometer, that\u0026rsquo;s the basic mechanism for doing this. And so we have a video here, I think, I can\u0026rsquo;t remember who does this video with a Shang Tong or Nigel but you\u0026rsquo;ll see this moving forward to hopefully show you how this works. This is Nigel Sousa used to be with us and so he\u0026rsquo;s holding a plate. There\u0026rsquo;s a button right here that he\u0026rsquo;s going to push this a semi automated he\u0026rsquo;s going to place the plate in place, there\u0026rsquo;s a laser Red Cross that you can sort of see there, you\u0026rsquo;ll align your physically align the cross with the TLC spot, and when they\u0026rsquo;re aligned, you press that blue button and the head comes down. presses on the TLC spot in pass a solvent through it. He loots it up to the mouth spectrometer. And so that\u0026rsquo;s TLC, Ms. Ms spectrum shown there and the ion current profile on the left. If you have another spot, you can keep the mass spectrometer scanning, it\u0026rsquo;s not looking anything but continuous flow. And you can move the plate when you peg places device down on the silica silica particles are caught in the screen. And we actually use as a final step before the next spot we puff it with nitrogen we blow out pieces of, of silica into a waste bucket, basically a little little cup if you will. So between each spot illusion, we nitrogen through the screen to clean it off to go to the next sample. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll show this later. So we have a switching Val that is automated by the software. So the components are SSI, that\u0026rsquo;s a company that makes our pump on isocratic pump. You one you the chemists puts the solvent in that\u0026rsquo;s typically high percentage of methanol, it\u0026rsquo;s low percentage of water with a little bit of formic acid, some sort of a loose and solid the two noble dissolve the analyte. And so we have a nitrogen line here that\u0026rsquo;s in this x part of the experiment. It\u0026rsquo;s not lined up. We\u0026rsquo;ve got an Isochronic pump delivering sample through the valve continually seek to the mass spectrometer and you\u0026rsquo;ll see nothing\u0026rsquo;s really happening here. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a probe this probe is gonna come down out of the TLC plate, liquids going to go down through through the plate to the spot back up to the mass spectrometer, that\u0026rsquo;s what this next slide shows where the isocratic pump the valves and switch and now the Aleutian solid eluding the analyte. From the spot, the solvent comes down and the directional arrows comes down we the clamp had has come down and made a a, a barrier around the spot of physical stainless steel barrier, so liquid cannot leak out, it\u0026rsquo;s a leak type barrier, it\u0026rsquo;s actually a stainless steel wedge that comes down, you\u0026rsquo;ll see it in the laboratory solvent comes down then passes through the spot. And so doing it\u0026rsquo;s dissolving the drug or analyte from the silica and moving it back up through the valve to the mass spectrometer that only takes a few seconds, as the video just showed it within 1010 seconds, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the illusion that\u0026rsquo;s instead of scraping it with a spatula, putting it into a test to putting solvent in and shaking it, spinning it filtering it blowing it down. It\u0026rsquo;s automated direct dilution. And if there\u0026rsquo;s five spots on the plate, you can do five in direct sequence by just lifting the head, puffing off the silica, moving the spot under the laser crosshairs that you\u0026rsquo;ll see in the lab. The next spot pushing the blue button, it takes a minute or two or less to do multiple spots on the plate. The final step is the puffing of the nitrogen. Here you see nitrogen supplied to it, and it goes through the bow comes down and goes. There\u0026rsquo;s a fret on the bottom here that has silica particles, and as well as some of the previous sample. And so we don\u0026rsquo;t want to have carryover. So this step removes that silica, and continues to loop the solvent so you don\u0026rsquo;t have carryover. So those are the three main steps of the TLC MLS. Here\u0026rsquo;s a zooming in on the physical situation at the TLC plate. So these are the stainless steel edges, it\u0026rsquo;s an oval, not a circular but kind of an oval. And these stainless steel edges on the head of the system come down and crushed down onto the silica and make a leak Tight, tight barrier. Meanwhile, the illusion solid is going to come down through this into this bed of silica, you\u0026rsquo;re going to see this is this is a poor joke for Wilmington, North Carolina, you\u0026rsquo;re going to see the liquid level rise, but it\u0026rsquo;s safe, nobody\u0026rsquo;s gonna be hurt here. Oh, the flooding those poor folks are getting. And so as the liquid continues to come in, it\u0026rsquo;s eluding the drug or chemicals from that TLC plate and spot and passing it back up through this line going directly to the mass spectrometer. When that has taken place, and you see the mass spectrum, you keep this in place during that you actually lift this up by pushing the button and Puff the nitrogen. So if there\u0026rsquo;s any silica caught up in this fret that\u0026rsquo;s in here, this puffed out, and you go to the next spot. And here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a TLC plate sampled in three different ways. Usually, the the look, the band or the spot at the lowest Rf is the narrowest higher revenue resolution, because there\u0026rsquo;s more broadening as it takes place. Later on, I got to get this pointer to work for me. And so that\u0026rsquo;s the summary of how that TLC ms solution is done. TLC analyses can help determine the molecular mass, that\u0026rsquo;s mostly the thing. Most common question on organic chemists or an analyst might ask is what is the molecular weight of what I\u0026rsquo;m getting? Determine the chemical structure if you knew if you\u0026rsquo;re going to interpret the mass spectrum, verify the suspected identity that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s the most common concept, you think you know what that spot is get the mass spectrum, the truth machine tells you whether it is or not, you can also determine the purity of the sample because the if there\u0026rsquo;s multiple components in it, they will be separated on a TLC plate. And of course, reaction monitoring synthetic chemists use this commonly use TLC GCMs or LC ms analysis, the TLC plate. This is not available that done with our system, that means scraping the spot extracting it possible further purification and so forth. Instead of all that work. You do this approach and it\u0026rsquo;s more straightforward. TLC CMS can provide a simple direct analysis of these TLC spots. This is not a large market, but certainly on colleges and universities with students. It\u0026rsquo;s a common fun experiment for a student to do. There\u0026rsquo;s also there\u0026rsquo;s medicines and various dyes as our frequent situation is the Sharpie pens, you take the red pen, it\u0026rsquo;s a series of colors you can easily do TLC separation easily see the spots in a loop them by TLC MS and you can get the mass spectrum and that plus other than training aspects, synthetic chemists monitoring their reactions. So moving on then to the pipe idea of Simon taneous positive negative switching is alternately rapidly switching from one polarity to the other. So one scan is positive, one next scan is negative, next scan is positive and so forth. So you get to I encourage to chromatograms, you get two sets of mass spectra. And it\u0026rsquo;s a good way to determine whether your molecule responds best to positive ion, or shall I say, positive or negative is the best way to way to put that that is entirely possible without with our system to do that. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether that\u0026rsquo;s shown in the lab or not. Polarity switching can help maintain Mass Information about knowing without knowing the preferred ionization mode. For each chemical compound, now, I should make it clear that this can be done under electrospray conditions positive negative, or APCI. Conditions positive or negative, not alternating APCI electrospray, it\u0026rsquo;s one or the other. Add add that on the market by other vendors. They have dual APCI CI, and I like to remind us that like anything made to do two or more things that doesn\u0026rsquo;t do either them as well as if they were made to do one thing. And so those companies that do sell simultaneous dual APSA, electrospray, they don\u0026rsquo;t work very well. Examples of TLC applications active ingredient conformation analgesic drugs is a really common situation. I mentioned reaction monitoring for organic synthesis. Analysis of natural extracts such as vanilla extract, vanilla extract of oils, specialty oils, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot there\u0026rsquo;s a fair amount of fraudulent manufacture of specialty oils, virgin olive oil, so to speak, there\u0026rsquo;s a real difference between the chemistry a virgin olive oil and regular olive oil. And we and with this technology, you can show the difference show which one it is. But a common one is analgesic drugs. So here\u0026rsquo;s ibuprofen and a whole series of different ones and conditions use, you can do TLC separation, you pulverize the pill, extract it, apply it to the origin of the TLC plate and then develop it, which means putting the plate into the bottom half of Bob Bob about a centimeter deep of the developing solid putting the cover on the top half of the tank coming back in 10 minutes on the development will take place. You can often see the spots by holding a UV light on it. There are other things such as cryogenic cryo giant Chromogenic sprays that highlight these chemicals. The easiest way is of UV light, and we often circle them with a pencil. And that shows you where to drop the head of the TLC system onto the spot. So here\u0026rsquo;s a spot or plate under fluorescence lamp showing the spots separated. Here\u0026rsquo;s acetaminophen, here\u0026rsquo;s aspirin. Now, these are duplicate applications redundant, if you will, the same thing caffeine and ibuprofen, an acid. And so this distance between the origin and here is called the RF, the relative migration. And you can see the RF so dramatically difference between these two, they\u0026rsquo;re easily separated. But if you want to get a mass spectrum of any one of these, you put this whole plate underneath that the plate Express and you can get the mass spectrum as I showed. So here\u0026rsquo;s an example with with acetaminophen with Tylenol. This is the iron current profile, here\u0026rsquo;s a spot here, the plate, the head is come down, surrounded that spot sawin has come down going through the silica backup to the mass spectrometer. Here\u0026rsquo;s the product if you will. And then here\u0026rsquo;s the mass spectrum from that the impalas H. In this case, you might see, you can see that as an M plus H plus acetonide trail, what the heck is that? A C trail is the illusion solvent. And sometimes under certain conditions, we have an adduct of proton bound acetonide trail. So it\u0026rsquo;s an M plus 42. A C naught trail as a molecular weight of 41. A proton added is 42. And we do see that in some cases, you can look at it as a problem in that you only want to see one peak or you can look at it as a positive. That is a double confirmation on the microwave. You\u0026rsquo;ve got an M plus h e, okay, the molecular weights 151. But we also see this peak at 193. And that\u0026rsquo;s 42 mass units above so we\u0026rsquo;ve got two measurements verifications of the molecular weight. That\u0026rsquo;s how you convert a negative into a positive with your positive thinker. Here\u0026rsquo;s negative ion detection. In this example, here, positive and negative, positive and negative. So an offset there this is a formic acid addict in that case, and so there\u0026rsquo;s a structure for acetaminophen. So not neophytes are new people to mass spectrometry, all they want is a molecular weight. They really don\u0026rsquo;t even want an n plus h they want The M, we don\u0026rsquo;t give you them unless you do what I said this morning with PHS. And they really don\u0026rsquo;t want to see these other attics. But the arithmetic doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to be calculus level, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do too much math, you just need to know that some of these common things, there are 100 of them, or even 20 of them, there\u0026rsquo;s a handful of C nitrile methanol. So n plus 450 23. n plus 3332 plus one. acetate is 59. There\u0026rsquo;s a handful of these addicts. And you just keep these in mind, some of the software systems can actually highlight these for you and tell you what they are. So here\u0026rsquo;s a cup of coffee, you can apply we all know caffeine isn\u0026rsquo;t coffee, you know that decaffeinated coffee is not fully decaffeinated. It\u0026rsquo;s just less caffeine. I have a sister in law who swears that any caffeine at all was bother her and I showed her results that that normally six to 8% caffeine and regular coffee is 1% or less, but it\u0026rsquo;s still caffeine but doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. If you if you put coffee on TLC play and develop it. Caffeine looks like this with a PCI. By the way with that TLC, Ms. Plate Express, you\u0026rsquo;re going to API or electrospray is depends on what source you\u0026rsquo;re, you\u0026rsquo;re putting in the extract of the spot into. So coffee, caffeine, no big deal, a great student experiment to do something like this students love some common. Each of these examples I\u0026rsquo;m showing are common examples of products that you might have in your wallet or your purse or your suitcase or briefcase and can easily show presence of these compounds. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying anything about quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis is much more work in this. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying it cannot be done. But it takes a series of experiments including a calibration curve, ideally a stabilized open turning standard. That\u0026rsquo;s the way to do high quality quantitative analysis. It can be done but it\u0026rsquo;s best done by LCMS. So these Ambien ionization techniques are less amenable to quantitative analysis, but it can be done. So here\u0026rsquo;s TLC, CMS, of aspirin from Bayer. Similarly, here we have a Impalas, H adduct of formic acid, we have in this negative ion mold, we have the minus h minus and in this case, we have a fragmentation, if you will, is an easily lost fragment. In doing that probably due to the heat associated with the ion source. The ionization itself is generally mild heat can cause for Fragile molecules to fragment, in addition, so there\u0026rsquo;s aspirin, pretty common drug Advil as well known similarly, easily determined by this ion chrome profile the illusion of the spot from the plate, notice how it\u0026rsquo;s kind of tailing. This is a form of flow injection analysis that spots being alluded as being directly into the instrument. It\u0026rsquo;s like injecting with a syringe only is automated in this case. And so here we have the minus h minus and again a fragment ion from the Viper Provan. And there is its structure. It\u0026rsquo;s an acid carboxylic acid. General organic chemistry lab, the active ingredient and animal see that drug samples can be directly determined by TLC CMS. A summary of these what I\u0026rsquo;ve just shown you the system is easily amenable for the general organic lab for undergraduate training and research. We just installed a system at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York, that\u0026rsquo;s a very active undergraduate program. They have a massive program to but many, many students, and they really believe in hands on use, and they\u0026rsquo;re fighting, they have a signup sheet you might have if it really gets popular, you have to have a sign up sheet. So these kids don\u0026rsquo;t come in and push each other around, they got to take their turn. But they really like doing experiments like this. It\u0026rsquo;s hands on experiment, not along lecture. Chemistry, students can benefit from this by gaining TLC experience as well as a modern detector to measure what they\u0026rsquo;re what the spots are. Synthetic reactions. This is a Suzuki reaction. That\u0026rsquo;s a very popular reaction for medicinal chemists making new drugs. In this case, it\u0026rsquo;s bromo, para bromo Anlin with a boronic acid and these details in the reaction mixture sodium hydroxide, I hate to think of putting sodium as I mentioned before in the instrument, this reaction pot is going to have a lot of cement oxide in it. Palladium chloride, ethanol, water and so forth. But if you put together reaction, A B, CD reagents and E that\u0026rsquo;s what each of these is and the molar amounts is the way I used to run a reaction, you are running a Suzuki reaction and you can monitored over a course of time. You can also put it on a TLC plate as a function of time here zero minutes out to 180 minutes. Here\u0026rsquo;s a standard of this reactance and the starting materials You can monitor the reaction by TLC, and then measure each of these spots. When you\u0026rsquo;re all done, you actually run out the whole reaction, applying these samples at regular times, and then you do the TLC Ms. Developing solving this case has benzene. So remember, this molecule, as the other example shows that there\u0026rsquo;s a bromine. And when you get a mass spectrum abroad, or brominated compound, you\u0026rsquo;ve got this doublet if you will almost equal intensity to this bromine, 79 and bromine at one, and it stands out very readily. There\u0026rsquo;s another example of it with the maths and here we have the product, which does not have a bromine, bromine has been displaced. And so you easily can differentiate the product from the reactant. But simply in this special case, the absence of the doublet. Here\u0026rsquo;s a ion current profile from the TLC plate, from zero out through 120 180 minutes, notice how the product is increasing with time. But if you go too long, it starts to decrease that relates to what I said before, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to run a reaction longer than it needs to run. And so you can easily mounter these things the extracted diet current here for product ions, and here\u0026rsquo;s the product extracted, I incurrence, further reactants, product ions form reactants fine, or Alex decreased love it when a plan comes together makes perfect sense. And that\u0026rsquo;s really powerful for a synthetic chemists to be able to do that. And this makes it easy to do it. Natural vanilla, extract three different mineral extracts from the local market, done by TLC. So here\u0026rsquo;s one, two and three, the duplicates of two and three, and the developing up here, the solvent front is up here. So it\u0026rsquo;s an RF of about point six or seven. And so each of those files can be analyzed the major ingredient and natural extract is vanillin. However, it samples may contain ethyl denoted, which does not exist in nature. It says synthetic compounds, so somebody souping up or degrading the quality of the product. fraudulent behavior in medicines and foods is an unfortunate fact of life. And I see job security on using mass spectrometry to show these folks that they\u0026rsquo;re misbehaving. And so there\u0026rsquo;s, I guess, I guess pretty well, RF a point five, seven is point roughly point six. And so we\u0026rsquo;re have a RL small spot, you have to look carefully, but there\u0026rsquo;s spots up there. By the way, there needs to be in general, fairly high levels. To see these spots. This is not a sensitive technique unless you\u0026rsquo;re using fluorescence reserving for example, on a TLC spot on there. Fluorescence is very, very sensitive, but many, many applications that detection has a sense of so there\u0026rsquo;s plenty on this plate for the mass spectrometer to see. But unlike the synthetic organic chemists, it\u0026rsquo;s not 10s of micrograms either, it\u0026rsquo;s not too much. It\u0026rsquo;s a nice amount of typical TLC spot, that\u0026rsquo;s not as big as your hand I\u0026rsquo;m exaggerating, or your thumbnail, which some people believe in, these are fairly decent spots, they should be less than half a centimeter or so. And so the amount of sample is plenty, but not too much for detecting with a mass spectrometer. So here\u0026rsquo;s AMS spots. So this at RF 2.57 positive ion mode, negative ion mode looks like unlike your weight of 151, as shown there. And there is the I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, with only one safety too with the addition of the proton or the loss of the proton. This is a weak acid, it\u0026rsquo;s a funnel. So to me, it makes sense to take a look at negative ion detection, I can deprotonate that, that also has an O H that I can protonate it has an ether oxygen, I can protonate it as a carbonyl. So I can I have three different locations with a sufficient proton affinity to put a proton. So both positive and negative work with this, if I was going to do lots of analysis and wanted to have clean results, I would lean towards negative ions because as I said before fewer interferences, chemical interferences respond to negative ions, so you don\u0026rsquo;t see the chemical noise as much. The spots at the higher RF you\u0026rsquo;re at point seven has a different mass. Remember, this one was wanted the 2.9 and this one is 160 6.9. So that\u0026rsquo;s a different molecule. It\u0026rsquo;s different because it has a different Rf is different as shown here in terms of molecule weight. And so that\u0026rsquo;s ethyl vanillin, exact mass of 166. So here\u0026rsquo;s a simple method that a student can do or synthetic or anyone could do TGT. LCMS. Certainly there\u0026rsquo;s other ways to doing this LC Ms. could certainly do this. But this is kind of dumb, easy TLC plate. Anybody can do. As someone mentioned, they\u0026rsquo;re inexpensive. You don\u0026rsquo;t lose a lot of solvent. It\u0026rsquo;s a it\u0026rsquo;s a good fits in the most college budgets. consumables, if you will. So sample two contains a full Dunellen synthetic compound with vanilla flavors, so they\u0026rsquo;re faking it, putting in this to make it taste more like real vanilla. It\u0026rsquo;s not found in samples one and three, but it was in to summary, direct ambient TLC CMS compact mass spectrometry of each drugs from the TLC plate and confirm the identity, including providing molecular mass, and MT LC MS is affordable to fit in general organic chemistry laboratories, undergraduate laboratories to receive luminary training and this technology, and ambient TLC, CMS also saves the chemists time by not requiring scraping extract the purification, the method development and the sample preparation associated with full fashioned TLC amounts. The combination of this technology can be an official tool for many TLC applications. And of course, I acknowledge before though that the primary application and see our education training and colleges, as well as synthetic chemists are the main focuses they\u0026rsquo;ll use it, occasionally a forensic laboratory would, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s less and less. So do you have any questions on TLC CMS?\nPart 4B #  Alright, this is quite new. We call it touch Express. That\u0026rsquo;s our name. It has, it\u0026rsquo;s a published technology called the open port sampling interface. Opposite. This is from a laboratory at Oak Ridge National Laboratories, a collaborator, and colleague, and it\u0026rsquo;s Gary van Berkel and his team at Oak Ridge, and it made the cover of analytical chemistry recently. And you, as anybody heard of this, I would guess you have not, unless you\u0026rsquo;re really keeping up the literature, but we have access to the technology, we have a license to use it on a single quadrupole. So I access license to use the technology because they supported the research on Triple quads and time of flights and so forth. And so I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the analogy of a drinking fountain. Here\u0026rsquo;s a child drinking from a drinking phone. And that\u0026rsquo;s more water and more liquid than than we use. But this region right here is a micro drinking phone. So there\u0026rsquo;s liquid coming up here at a slow rate. And it\u0026rsquo;s going back down into here into the mass spectrometer. And it forms a meniscus a little tiny version of this, I don\u0026rsquo;t know that this is a good analogy or not, but I think it is because we\u0026rsquo;re going to continuously deliver this is not LCMS. This is another form of flow injection analysis, that at the present time is done manually. But there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interest in somehow automating this. And there\u0026rsquo;s progress along those lines, not so much by us yet. But we\u0026rsquo;re interested in this. And so think of a drinking fountain with a tiny, tiny meniscus. And if you can apply a tiny, tiny drop of your sample from a pipette from a syringe needle manually, maybe just inject a microliter into this little well, it will be instantly dissolved. And we\u0026rsquo;ll go down this line to the mass spectrometer and go undergo either electrospray or APCI, depending upon what source you\u0026rsquo;re using. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at some more detail. Here it is on the side of our instrument, you\u0026rsquo;ll see it when you go back in the lab. This port pride right here is that part right there. This is of course as a cartoon. And here\u0026rsquo;s the publication a year or so ago, this is quite new in the development of this technology, so there\u0026rsquo;s our little micro port. And it\u0026rsquo;s called the open port because it is opened developed here. Think of it as a drinking fountain as I said, a facile sample introduction for for liquids, followed by electrospray ionization, or AP similar to ASAP or AP APCI touch the sample to the meniscus and anything soluble will be transported to the region of the mass spectrometer source of the mat compact mass spectrometer, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take long, that takes just a few seconds, because the linear distance is not very far. Here\u0026rsquo;s the original publication in rapid communications, I think of mass spectrometry. To my knowledge, it\u0026rsquo;s only available from Sykes and ourselves because they\u0026rsquo;re the ones that license it. So here\u0026rsquo;s how this meniscus is formed here is liquid coming up. That\u0026rsquo;s almost too slow. Here\u0026rsquo;s liquid coming up this forming a flat if you will, a meniscus and here\u0026rsquo;s one with a slight bulging, so the surface tension liquids important so you don\u0026rsquo;t you don\u0026rsquo;t want this to overflow. You don\u0026rsquo;t want it to go so fast that it overflows, you\u0026rsquo;d waste the sample. And so there\u0026rsquo;s a solvent delivery system of infusion pump that comes into a tea, it goes up the outside of this inner capillary. So it\u0026rsquo;s a physical separation. The input solvent comes in forms the meniscus, you touch your sample with a pipette or sermon title to that meniscus. It\u0026rsquo;ll be instantly dissolved and be sucked down to the ion source, open port. So pro in 10 seconds or less. I might add there\u0026rsquo;s a Venturi effect of nebulizing gas that is there all the time from APCI and electrospray. is used a facility if you will, this downward movement of the solid. Here are a few pictures of Shang Tong using this recently. So taking a sample with a pipette, allocating out a microliter or less, and applying it to the open port, shown there, here is approaching it and here he is right on top of it. The downside of this as it takes a steady hand, there needs to be a robotics added to this and we\u0026rsquo;re not there yet. But it says GM Simple way to get quick mass spectra, analogous to some of the other things I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned. But we in solution, if you will. We call this touch Express. And here\u0026rsquo;s an example of of analyzing a sample containing a protein a couple different proteins. So there\u0026rsquo;s the pipette tip, there\u0026rsquo;s the miniature drinking fountain, to microliter drop a myoglobin, horse myoglobin and cytochrome c or use in 10 millimolar ammonium acetate, since these are proteins, this will be electrospray. The electrospray mass spectra concentration in this case is a milligram per mil but we\u0026rsquo;re only putting in two microliters. So there\u0026rsquo;s not very much put in and the transport solvent is at 250 microliters per minute. So this flow, right here is it 250 microliters a minute, right along the lines of what we typically do LCMS on. And here\u0026rsquo;s the mass spectrum, you get a multi charts on bloap of ions from plus nine up to plus 21 or plus 22. There is software that we have and others have that it\u0026rsquo;s called deconvolution software that converts all these multiple charged ions into one kind of a zero charge state and the molecular weight is 16,951.2. That was revolutionary in the mid 80s. When John Fen first reported capability. Most people especially organic chemists don\u0026rsquo;t do not want to see all these ions for one compound they want to see this bio chemists especially they want to know the molecular weight, but we can do that the software deconvolute it collapses all these into the actual zero charge state. And here is the showing the uncharged mass of the myoglobin. And this is cytochrome c another application or introduction of a different protein whose molecule is 12,359. There was a time we cannot conceive of analyzing molecules with a mass spectrometer 1615 12,000 molecular weight electrospray made that all possible. So that was done with the open port source interface. Here\u0026rsquo;s another example of a quantitation without chromatography. I find this hard to believe but it\u0026rsquo;s was nicely done. This is fentanyl in New York and you\u0026rsquo;re probably heard about that nail it\u0026rsquo;s very very potent drug. Here is it structure and molecular weight at 336. fast acting synthetic painkiller. 100 times stronger than morphine. opsi can be a simple screening tool for fentanyl samples from a colonoscopy patient was given fentanyl and medazepam. This is a common low dose mixture for to put someone out during a colonoscopy applicable to screening of fentanyl as a drug of abuse also, so the sample preparation use the deuterated internal standard we\u0026rsquo;re doing quantitation. So we want an isobaric molecule it\u0026rsquo;s just got additional deuterium atoms or carbon 13. And that was added to this sample liquid the sample preparation was urine. So it was not untreated urine it was extracted urine liquid liquid extraction using one to one ethyl acetate hexane vortex mixed, let\u0026rsquo;s Stan one mil of the supernatant was transferred to a clean vial evaporated to dryness in reconstituted in 250 microliters of methanol, the transport solvent that I indicated it runs at 250 microliters per minute, you\u0026rsquo;re not doing chromatography you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about water or methanol or accomplishing chromatography. You can use a preferred electrospray solvent which is methanol, you\u0026rsquo;re going to use 100% methanol which makes it work the best or it can be methanol water, maybe 8020 or 9010. And so those are the conditions two microliters of this extract from 250 microliters in methanol was just touched or transferred to the micro drinking fountain of the mass spectrometer. And here is the mass spectra mass spectrum for fentanyl. Here is D five and fentanyl so the aromatic ring has five to term atoms. So it\u0026rsquo;s five mass units higher mass. It\u0026rsquo;s behaving chemically, during the extraction as well as everything else identical to fentanyl. And so we have a very clean spectrum with no fragmentation and we\u0026rsquo;re going to have an ion current profile for the D five Sentinelle as well as the D zero and we\u0026rsquo;re going to have a calibration curve where there\u0026rsquo;s a fixed amount the same amount of the internal standard is in every sample. But of course that we\u0026rsquo;re going to increase the amount of D zero fentanyl to create a calibration curve. And that calibration curve is a ratio of D zero to D five at different concentrations of D zero. They all follow that that standard quantitative analysis, only we\u0026rsquo;re not doing LC. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of surprising this works worked as well as it does. So here\u0026rsquo;s a control, meaning it has the D five internal standard, but no added fentanyl. So it\u0026rsquo;s a negative control this four to five of the D five, so there\u0026rsquo;s no significant interference. This is an foi a tight peek at some by selected on monitoring for the M plus H for both the D zero and D five. Here\u0026rsquo;s the calibration curve, each of these points is a ratio of the peak area of D zero to D five d zero to D five at higher levels and perfectly linear calibration curve with these points. And with that calibration curve now you take this unknown sample prepared in the same way. And you see where that concentration lies on this calibration curve. Here are the peaks then this is the d five ion current profile not a chromatogram is an FIA ion current profile. And we use in the software that\u0026rsquo;s only we saw in the last lab section, we get an automatic automated definition of the base of the P and you measure the area of this versus area of this and that\u0026rsquo;s the ratio. And with that we determine the levels of offense fentanyl in that sample. So here\u0026rsquo;s calibration one through eight in triplicate, here\u0026rsquo;s a concentration two and a half nanograms per mil to 500 nanograms per mil, it\u0026rsquo;s well known that the normal dose is in this range, the calculated concentration, average accuracy all the way across here is sample one, sample two and sample three of the of the patient. And so it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly good quantitative analysis without LCMS. The sobering thing since I built qual CRO based upon LC MS. MS, there are increasing examples of quantitative analysis without the LLC, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we\u0026rsquo;re gonna put it out of business by any means. But increasingly, if you work smart, if you have a selective sample preparation, this was a nice clean extract of hexane ethyl acetate, oftentimes, with as power of mass spectrometry, you can do quantitation, without MSMS, or without HPLC. That\u0026rsquo;s not across the board, it\u0026rsquo;s not always going to be the case. These levels are fairly fairly routine, easy levels by today\u0026rsquo;s standards. If these levels were to be 1000 times lower, I would want to be doing HPLC and probably MSMS. We don\u0026rsquo;t reach as low with this approach, as that might require. Here is a PK a pharmacokinetic curve, the samples were taken at time zero and out through six hours. The samples were not collected further, but you can see it peaked at about two hours patient probably woke up somewhere in here and collected samples out through here. And so it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s not a full PK curve, but it\u0026rsquo;s representative of what the pharmaceutical industry always generates. That\u0026rsquo;s what we do across down the street here is generate quantitative analysis for the pharmacokinetic curve and pharmacodynamics. Touch Express then conclusions surmountable for qualitative and quantitative analysis, simple, robust manual operation, no mechanical or moving parts, fast analysis, seconds analysis, time direct sampling, just touch an assay, I would be in truth of advertising touch, you need a steady hand to touch and time hopefully we have robotic ways of doing that. But with a steady hand, you can definitely do it. No carryover or contamination. It\u0026rsquo;s continually flushing itself. It\u0026rsquo;s a constant flow of a high base, solid soil solvent solvent that dissolves almost anything organic methanol. And so it\u0026rsquo;s continuously self cleaning, a cost effective High Throughput Screening technique, samples, any sizable samples touched the port that you might have small surfaces tablets, we even held a tomato that have been a full tomato that have been sprayed with pesticides up to that liminal schism instantly you see the pesticides that sits on the surface of the tomato, you don\u0026rsquo;t see the pesticides that are inside, liquids dispense pipette tips, etc. Here are publications related to that Abyan publications, if you will, as well as that from Gavin berkland demos Cortez at North at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. So we\u0026rsquo;re quite excited about this pushing limits of what it can do. There\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s quite new, a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t know about it. It\u0026rsquo;s not the answer to everything, but it\u0026rsquo;s another very useful tool. It would be really student friendly. It would be really friendly to an organic chemist or somebody wanting a quick result.\n"},{"id":133,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Advion-Courses/Lecture-05/","title":"Lecture 5 - Principles for Successful LC/MS","section":"Advion Courses on LC-MS","content":"What does the successful LC-MS look Like? or What is the principles that produce good successful data? or What do you address when developing a new method?\nI want the isotopes to be as they should be.\n whether a molecule is basic, or acidic  So let\u0026rsquo;s let\u0026rsquo;s begin with the lecture five, shown on the slide, principles of successful LCMS. The more experience you have in this field, the better you get at developing methods, optimizing the method, generating nice data that\u0026rsquo;s publishable and presentable, just getting a mess spectrum or my view that looks crappy is not really success, you want to I want the isotopes to be as they should be, I want the chromatographic peaks to not bother are card carrying chromatography chromatography is look at LC peaks and milliseconds, they can tell whether it was a good run, or that the person knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing. And showing the data of both the mass spectrometry data and the LC data, or experienced observer can easily tell whether the user knew what they were doing, whether it\u0026rsquo;s good data or not. If you are in high stakes, environments, like a forensic laboratory, where it goes to court and in my racehorse drug testing days, a $10,000, fine, was like a $5 parking ticket for us, they would gladly pay $10,000. But if they were forbidden to race, in New York State for three months, that\u0026rsquo;s most of the season that was a big hit. And so they pulled out the top guns, the attorneys, an expert witnesses many a time I\u0026rsquo;ve gone against expert witnesses, who would pick pick away at the data, try to find something wrong. And if you\u0026rsquo;re in such a high stakes environment, you want to do good results, you want good solid results, including chain of evidence, but the analytical chemistry itself. And so one of the points of this lecture is to understand the principles that produce good successful data. So developing a method and LCMS method that means that you have a lot of things addressed and some of those things are on here. And knowing organic chemistry, we are primarily talking about organic molecules as opposed to inorganic molecules. And under I asked yesterday, how many of you remember some of and have experience with organic chemistry, knowing the basics, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be an expert at it. But whether a molecule is basic, or acidic, that helps us decide whether to do positive or negative ion. Simple as that is that heat sensitive, I mentioned classes of compounds are known to be heat sensitive. Typically, they\u0026rsquo;re peroxides. That\u0026rsquo;s an oxygen oxygen bond, single bond sulfoxides and oxidize sulfur cell phones is a doubly oxidized sulfur, nitrogen, can they oxidize the oxides, these are weak bonds and are labile sensitive to excessive heat, even the heat that we subject these two, as a brief digression, you know what the Leidenfrost effect 1 is, if you ever iron your clothes, and you want to know when the flat iron is hot, enough to iron, one of the things you could do is this and touch it. That monolayer of your saliva liquid water does a steam quick steam distillation and creates a barrier so you don\u0026rsquo;t burn your finger. If you touch your dry finger to the flat iron, you burn your finger. But if you do what I just suggested, that\u0026rsquo;s the Leidenfrost effect. Google it, you\u0026rsquo;ll see. in LCMS, what that\u0026rsquo;s what we have, we have our molecules surrounded by water vapor. So in a way, many of these are molecules are stable, because they\u0026rsquo;ve got a moisture layer around them. And even though it\u0026rsquo;s hot, they\u0026rsquo;re protected by a layer of water, but extremely thermal thermally labile molecules like those I just mentioned, are so labile that even that little layer of water burns their finger if you will, or Pyro breaks them down. And so the good news is the Leidenfrost protects our molecules in many cases, but not all. So heat sensitive is the molecule heat sensitive that should there guide you as to how much heat to use in the capillary. Our inlet capillary the first surface that will the second surface that our molecule sees. The first surface is the sprayer itself, the heated sprayer, if you will, and the second is the heated capillary. And then there are heated surfaces inside the vacuum system but generally our molecules don\u0026rsquo;t see those surfaces they\u0026rsquo;re in the gas phase. And if they hit a surface we lose them we never see them. So inside the vacuum system that\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s all okay it\u0026rsquo;s in the heat of capillary primarily is the molecule Seibel in the mobile phase and conditions that you\u0026rsquo;re using that\u0026rsquo;s generally case but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have precipitation occurs, we are doing evaporation, the droplets remember go from larger to smaller and smaller, if the molecule is partially soluble in that mixture combination, it can actually form a precipitate at a particle We don\u0026rsquo;t ionize particles, we will have poor sensitivity, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people that have actually done are doing that. And without knowing that they have terrible sensitivity, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to blame the mass spectrometer. But as I said yesterday, if you don\u0026rsquo;t get the eye into it, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to show it any results from it. And so what we do in the process is important, sustainability is important, and is the molecule polar or nonpolar polar molecules are nicely done by electrospray. If it\u0026rsquo;s truly a nonpolar molecule, it may or may not work with electrospray. But a very well may work by APCI. So these these choices that you are should be making as the captain of your own ship, you\u0026rsquo;re the chemist, you\u0026rsquo;re the one setting out to develop a method on a new molecule, a new drug or new whatever the situation is, if you\u0026rsquo;re in a lab, a lot laboratory like Andrea was with an EPA laboratory, there are methods already established, and you\u0026rsquo;re happy to follow them, the method development has already been done. Oftentimes, it takes five years to get that method developed, and approved, because it\u0026rsquo;s sent out to round robin laboratories, everybody tries to do it. And they all decide when it\u0026rsquo;s right. And then everybody must follow that that\u0026rsquo;s not developing a method that\u0026rsquo;s using one that somebody else has developed. But in our world, in many people\u0026rsquo;s world, you have a new compound a new situation, and you have to develop an LCMS method. So that\u0026rsquo;s developing the choice of the ionization, the choice of the chromatography, the choice of the mass spectrometer, so sometimes, if you need a high resolution, accurate mass measurement, our instruments not going to help you. It\u0026rsquo;s a quadrupole. It\u0026rsquo;s a good quadrupole. But it\u0026rsquo;s not high resolution. For that you need a Fourier transform spectrometer, a time of lightness and mass analyzer, or an orbitrap, high price tickets, half million, $300 million. So choices, the tools that you use, the iron source selection, electrospray, or APCI, we\u0026rsquo;ve touched upon that, importantly, the column selection, LC columns costs quite a lot from a cheap one is 150 to $200, expensive ones are $1,000, they don\u0026rsquo;t last forever, a good column will handle a appropriately, will maybe run 1000 samples. So it\u0026rsquo;s a consumable. And because it cost so much, there are many different columns out there, you probably can\u0026rsquo;t afford to have an example of all of them, you want to have a representative range of polarities from reverse phase, like C 18, to a medium polarity, like on amino propyl or cyanwood, propyl, two very polar columns, like a silica column or a Hilic column. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to have all of these. But when you\u0026rsquo;re developing a method, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to place an order and wait three days or a week to get a new one, you should have a range of three to five different polarity columns. So you can pull it out of the drawer and put it on your system to see how well it works for this method that you\u0026rsquo;re developing. It\u0026rsquo;s true, though, that might many people use only see a teen, you can sort of get away with that, but many of your separations will be suboptimal, they will not be as good as separation is if you use the appropriate column for the compound that you\u0026rsquo;re looking at because of its polarity. We have normal phase columns that are that are silica without any stationary phase bear silica is what a normal phase is. And by the way gradients, a gradient program is not relevant to normal phase, we often almost always use gradient and reverse phase chromatography, but a gradient in a normal phase is not done, it\u0026rsquo;s almost always isocratic. So the mobile phase composition you can go from zero water to 100% water or zero methanol to 100% methanol. And it\u0026rsquo;s usually such a combination those common mixtures are aqueous methanol, or aqueous acetonide trail there, there are subtle differences between them. And it may be your personal preference, or there may be some reason why one is going to be better than other. So reverse phase and notice how I\u0026rsquo;ve written it, it\u0026rsquo;s Edie hyphen, if I review your paper, I will be picky and point that out not a big deal that you want to appear as smart as you are. And so these are polar aqueous organic solvents with additives, meaning often acid we acid such as formic acid or acetic acid or if you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a basic mobile phase, then it would be ammonium hydroxide trimethylamine triethylamine, some of these low molecular weight species and normal phase solvents or nonpolar solvents such as hexane is the most common one. And you have the choice are you going to have a gradient separation or or isocratic separation, a gradient newsy is analogous to a temperature program and GCMS you must have done lots of GC temperature programming. It\u0026rsquo;s It\u0026rsquo;s It\u0026rsquo;s solvent mixture programming in this case, and rather than having a runtime of 45 minutes while like this, if you use a gradient, or a temperature program, you shorten the runtime, you also compress the peaks, you narrow the peaks. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing quantitation. That\u0026rsquo;s a good thing because you\u0026rsquo;re getting the area under the peak that\u0026rsquo;s the constant durational that\u0026rsquo;s a big fat broad peaks is, is less precision and accuracy for your software to define the baseline of that peak. And very importantly is the sample matrix complexity. I mentioned yesterday, we\u0026rsquo;re I\u0026rsquo;m just became interested in breath analysis, the matrix in the breath is mainly lipids, not all kinds of proteins and in phospho, lipids and so forth, although I think there are some of those in there too, compared to urine with lots of salts and proteins and biological matrix, biological matrix, these are very complex. And to have good LCMS results, we need to do adequate sample preparation and optimal chromatography, those two things combined give us really good results. Now, you should be aware that there it is possible with certain systems to directly inject plasma, so thermal not dimension competition, but other main main companies acquired a company A while back, that was that produces what they called turbo chromatography. To me, it\u0026rsquo;s an exaggeration of the facts. But they actually that capability has a combination of software columns, and mass spectrometer, so they directly inject plasma into the LC system. And these are popular in clinical laboratories, hospital laboratories will dollar route all due respect to clinical laboratories. That\u0026rsquo;s where our blood goes when we have a blood test. These laboratories are run the people there are medical technologists, they\u0026rsquo;re not often PhD at organic chemists, they\u0026rsquo;re they\u0026rsquo;re good capable technicians, but they don\u0026rsquo;t have the time or they or the knowledge to develop high tech methods. And so they like the idea of directly injecting plasma and getting a result in this system from thermo, I forgot what they actually call the product, but it\u0026rsquo;s an integrated system of directly injection biological samples to do LCMS quantitation. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for all applications. One of the benefits of a sample extraction is concentrating the analyte, the target compound in the extract, if you have plasma, you\u0026rsquo;re not concentrating and you need really good sensitivity to have that work. But the only point of that is that it is actually possible in certain instances to directly inject plasma but most of case in our world that\u0026rsquo;s generally impractical to do that that\u0026rsquo;s a special system. The original company was called cohesive technologies. It was formed by scientists EVO that spawn out of waters and develop this and thermal purchase them. And so sample matrix complexity is really important. Directly objection directing, biological sample is quite tough. I have an old slide that I don\u0026rsquo;t have in this course, from the racehorse drug testing days, my wife would say, why don\u0026rsquo;t you just connect a mass spectrometer to a horse? Well, horses run 25 or 30 miles an hour, but I have a plastic horse a full size plastic horse that my student stole borrowed from Cornell was on a platform, we backed it up to the mass spectrometer put a piece of pressure tubing from underneath its hind legs to the mass spectrometer, and that\u0026rsquo;s the horse ms interface that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work very well. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it\u0026rsquo;s just a joke and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work very well. So the property the compounds, is it acidic or basic? Is it heat sensitive? excitability? And is it polar or less polar? These are the points we just discussed in some detail. ion source selection, so you\u0026rsquo;ve got tools in your toolbox and they are two of them or are you going to do electrospray or APCI. In many cases, either one will work in most cases one will work better than the other. So polar compounds are course are well suited for electrospray. Basic compounds can be very positive. And what I like about a basic compound with its basic it usually means that has a nitrogen in it a basic nitrogen, try meth try alkyl amines are the most basic Amman\u0026rsquo;s are much less basic, but still have some basicity to other hetero atoms, non carbon atoms that are useful for adding a proton or oxygen. And that\u0026rsquo;s where this term proton affinity comes in. Such molecules have a certain proton affinity that can be measured. It\u0026rsquo;s generally not available to us unless we look it up for the molecule. But the affinity of that molecule to a proton determines whether you can ionize it or not whether the ion the proton sits on that molecule, we talked about the PHS the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, they have no hetero atom, and there\u0026rsquo;s no place to put or accept a proton. And so we formed ions by charge exchange as I explained yesterday, no protonation less polar compounds. I mentioned steroids, lipids, cannabinoids, there\u0026rsquo;s quite a class of compounds that are considered nonpolar. And these are often better done more successfully by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The ion source optimization you experienced that yesterday you\u0026rsquo;ll learn the three or four parameters on our ion source that every mass spectrometer has related parameters voltages, and And those optimizations help you optimize the performance, mainly the sensitivity, the main thing that\u0026rsquo;s doing is, is improving the sensitivity. The mass resolution and mass axis calibration is not such as partially sensitivity, but it\u0026rsquo;s its peak shape and quality of the mass spectral data. And so and source optimization says, See lecture three Part B addicts, this is the the frustrating to novices that want just the molecular ion. And right at the beginning, remember I said that protonate, a molecule is not the molecular ion its terminology. By mass spectrometry definitions, the molecular ion is what you get an electron ionization, it\u0026rsquo;s m dot plus, it\u0026rsquo;s the molecule minus one electron. So it\u0026rsquo;s masses and is basically the same. So these protonated molecules, and as I said before, it\u0026rsquo;s not correct to say protonated molecule ion, because that\u0026rsquo;s redundant, of chemists knows the protonate molecule is going to be an ion. And so we have the formation of protonated molecule is generally a very abundant ion. But in electrospray, we see addicts, so here is a 393. And if you do the arithmetic, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get real hard, all you have to do is subtract 361, or 360, their actual molecular weight from this, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have a difference of 33 atomic mass units. And that\u0026rsquo;s because methanol bound by a proton is a bit attached to that molecule. So it\u0026rsquo;s a a protonated methanolic, Iam m plus 33. If you have an M plus 32, plus 23, what\u0026rsquo;s the 23? Sodium? Where did the sodium come from, you may have put it in there. Or it may be your mobile phase water sitting on the bottle for days and days, and leaching out in fantastic tiny amounts of sodium from the glass, there\u0026rsquo;s glass of the sodium and potassium in the glass bottles. If you use plastics, some people use polymer of high quality laboratory polymer plastics, so you don\u0026rsquo;t get sodium in there. It\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing, you can consider it an added confirmation like your wait. But what about this guy way out here. I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention this yesterday. This is where your organic synthesis people that think more is better. What happens this is a proton bound dimer. This is twice the molecular weight of the molecule in this instance, bound by a one proton. So there\u0026rsquo;s a bridge, there\u0026rsquo;s a proton in the middle, and the two molecules are here. This is a very reproducible artifact of injecting too much sample, the molecule is so concentrated in the gas phase, that they\u0026rsquo;re interacting with each other. And so what what happens to a novice and we have lots of customers that are new to mass spectrometry, and they think more is better. And they\u0026rsquo;re looking for the molecular weight. And let\u0026rsquo;s talk through this scenario here. This is the molecular protonated molecule that we\u0026rsquo;re looking for. In here. It\u0026rsquo;s quite abundant. But if one injects higher and higher concentrations of that molecule, mean, while they\u0026rsquo;re looking for that molecule, and they\u0026rsquo;ve already injected, maybe 100 micrograms, or 50 micrograms, way too much material, they run the experiment in electrospray. This applies mainly to electrospray. And they will not see this either at all. And by the way, they\u0026rsquo;re expecting a 361 ion. And so maybe they scan to 400. It goes to 2000. What are you saving for and what\u0026rsquo;s happening is this, this has been dramatically reduced, because it\u0026rsquo;s all go into this and they don\u0026rsquo;t see this because they\u0026rsquo;re not scanning out there. So I had my own homemade rule, I call it the hennion to to molecular weight two times I\u0026rsquo;m like wait plus 50. So you cannot be fooled by something like this on an unknown molecule A new molecule to you. When you when you scan full scan, run at least twice the expected microwave plus a bit more Eisley just 50. And then you won\u0026rsquo;t miss something like this. And so the typical scenario is they see this very weakly. And they think they have poor sensitivity. What they don\u0026rsquo;t know is all Ali Mala ions are going up here. So they inject even more in this goes down. And they\u0026rsquo;re still not scanning out here seeing this. So they\u0026rsquo;re not knowing what\u0026rsquo;s going on. And they get really frustrated and call us and what\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s going on. So be alert to that, especially when you have students using these things, that proton bound dimer and electrospray is a common artifact of too much sample. And it\u0026rsquo;s so common that what I just described, they don\u0026rsquo;t scan up far enough and they see a weak peak. So they injectable more and it goes down that drives them nuts. So be aware of that. In this bottom example, now we have atmospheric pressure come on. Chemical Ionization, by the way, this is this molecule is steroid and like your weight 360. So we saw the 361. And that same molecule under APCI conditions, remember this is a non relatively nonpolar compounds. We see the protonated molecule and sub fragmentation. Now, in this example, we see minimal fragmentation because electrospray is mild ionization some mild puts in parts very little energy to the molecule or to the ion APCI is also very mild on isation. But then when you have, if you\u0026rsquo;re an organic chemistry, realize that\u0026rsquo;s a tertiary alcohol, and it\u0026rsquo;s adjacent to a carbonyl. If you protonate that, that oh, ah, you have the incipient loss of water, it can readily lose water perform an lol cow diet or, or a conjugated CarBody de unsaturated system. So any amount of heat at all, doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much at all to facilitate the loss of water. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we have here, that you might even have loss of two water molecules from them. And so ionization is mild, but the heat associated with this process can cause some fragmentation, not a lot nowhere near as much as you get an electron ionization and electron ionization, it\u0026rsquo;s rare to even see the molecular ion. Because this molecule breaks up in so many ways. The E IMS spectrum is very complex for steroids, many, many fragments. So that\u0026rsquo;s enough on that. Moving to chromatography, there are a number of choices. Most of us do not use some of these, some of those that are least used by small molecule people are size exclusion chromatography, this would be used for for proteins and biological applications. There\u0026rsquo;s ion exchange chromatography, there is normal phase and reverse phase. In the vast majority of applications are reverse phase chromatography. Ion pair chromatography has some role in LCMS applications. Not shown here are two or two relatively new kinds of chromatography, and that\u0026rsquo;s called Haylock. Hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography. That\u0026rsquo;s an interesting new entry that can be useful in LCMS. If you have a sample that\u0026rsquo;s got a number of very nonpolar molecules in the presence of a novel, it\u0026rsquo;s a number of other very polar molecules. These these hillock columns can handle both of those fairly well. And another one is hmic. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This is relevant to buy biologics, proteins and peptides. And we, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a fair amount of experience with those, but most people using our instrument, do not use HBIC columns. So the two that are most important to your world are normal phase and reverse phase with emphasis on the reversed phase. Ca, teens cyclopropyl, amino phenol, each of those has varying degrees of polarity, not ca 10 being the most nonpolar columns, then available. The columns, of course look like this. Within the column is where the separation occurs, the proper choice of column is critical or very important. You want a nice chromatogram. If you have lots of samples, you don\u0026rsquo;t want 30 minute runs. If you do the arithmetic, you\u0026rsquo;ve got 100 samples, how many hours does it take to run all those samples? If you don\u0026rsquo;t have large numbers, I get the impression. None of you have high volume, sample volume throughput, you\u0026rsquo;re not running hundreds of samples. So that\u0026rsquo;s less relevant there. That the types of columns that you have an HPLC there are analytical ones with inside diameter. If you tell me about your method, and you are asking questions, one of the first questions I\u0026rsquo;ll ask is what is the inside diameter of the column you\u0026rsquo;re using? Because that because that dictates the flow rate. And remember the firehose effect we don\u0026rsquo;t want the mass spectrometer feeling like it\u0026rsquo;s drinking from a firehose. The most common inside diameters for most people today is 2.1 millimeter inside diameter, and that those optimal work optimally the optimum linear Vaci is about 200 microliters per minute, instead of a milliliter per minute. Historically, the one mil per minute columns are the 4.6 millimeter inside diameter, as long as 15 to 25 centimeters long. Those are almost dinosaurs. For most of us, most of us use much shorter columns, five centimeters long, 10 centimeters long being a relatively long one. preoperative columns have larger inside diameters because you\u0026rsquo;re loading a lot more sample on the that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s a factor to or an important fact that the insert in addition to the floor rate, the inside diameter determines the amount of sample you can load on the column. If you were to take one extreme, I guess I don\u0026rsquo;t have here the Nano you\u0026rsquo;ll the nanoscale column is less point one millimeter is 100 microns. And so nano columns are 75 microns to about 200 micron inside diameter. The sample capacity that column not surprising is very, very low. You cannot inject 50 mil nanograms on to such a column. It\u0026rsquo;s usually sub nanogram. So if you want to inject large amounts of sample on the column, you need a larger inside diameter. That\u0026rsquo;s what preoperative columns are where you can collect milligram quantities and sample instead of nanogram amounts. What are the columns made of most of them are stainless steel, they operate under high pressure. They in the old days, 6000 psi was considered really high. Now we have UHPLC or ultra high pressure ultra high performance ultra high price I like to say these are not not cheap. They have 1.7 micron particles, various tiny particles. And they operate under very high pressure as much as 25,000 psi, typically 10 to 15,000 is fairly normal right now we have a problem in the lab right now with one of the injectors from one of the vendors, and it\u0026rsquo;s leaking, and when you get above about 5000 psi, by the way peak tubing is, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I get to this later, but I want to make sure I cover this. The peak tubing is a wonderful thing compared to stainless steel tubing, you don\u0026rsquo;t really need wrenches, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to cut and handle we used to be all stainless steel, but peak tubing has a pressure limit. Do you know what the pressure is? What\u0026rsquo;s the maximum pressure if you have peak tubing connecting your column to your injector and to your mass spectrometer and what what\u0026rsquo;s the maximum pressure P can handle 3000 10,000 4000 absolute maximum 5000 You\u0026rsquo;re safe at 4000 psi. So if you go to UHPLC you should have noticed that you don\u0026rsquo;t use peak tubing in that it\u0026rsquo;s now all stainless steel fitting tubing with special fittings. That\u0026rsquo;s another thing you have to have. You need a little chest of drawers in your laboratory where there are certain ferals and fittings for for certain pressure regions. If you have UHPLC. It\u0026rsquo;s a separate set of fittings and ferals don\u0026rsquo;t mix those two high pressure names high headache if you use the wrong fittings because they will leak in leaking is you know, you can\u0026rsquo;t really tolerate leaking. So they\u0026rsquo;re also glass. This is glass columns. But that\u0026rsquo;s really low pressure, of course, for mostly for biomolecules, and right quite uncommon. But peak polymers are also common. And that\u0026rsquo;s made it easy to make fittings and so forth. But there are pressure limits to it. It\u0026rsquo;s also true that peak is somewhat softened by a CDI trail, you can use a CDI trail with peak tubing, but it will not last as long it softens in animals the leak in a few weeks, if you will. What is inside the column I hope everyone knows that or has thought about that sometimes particles, silica particles finally sieved, hopefully a narrow distribution in size, you don\u0026rsquo;t want them ranging from 1.7 microns to 10. microns, you want them ideally to be monodisperse or model the same all the same size. The puck part was small diameter, sometimes porous particles, that means this hole through them, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of information and more than you need to know here. And I won\u0026rsquo;t go into too much detail. But there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of science in modern developments in packings of columns. The most popular comment sizes are up of particles are five micron, that\u0026rsquo;s actually less popular these days, they used to be common, then they went to 3.5, or three microns. And now they\u0026rsquo;re 1.8 or 1.7. By that number, I can even tell what company makes it because waters makes 1.7 Somebody else makes 1.8. They\u0026rsquo;re all less than two microns. And that\u0026rsquo;s very, very small particle, they\u0026rsquo;re packed using high pressure there, they should, you should not really take them apart. If you disturb the bed, if you lose any of the packing, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a void in the column. And then that causes extra column variants that your peak shapes will start to be broadened and so forth. So you\u0026rsquo;ll want to treat them very carefully. Porous particles means that some of the solvent could go through the particle a kind of a tortuous path, that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing because it gives more time for the exchange of the molecules to the surface to take place. The stationary phase is an interaction between a competition between your analyte that\u0026rsquo;s in solution going through the column, if there was no packing, it would go straight through and not be retained, we want to have relative retention. If we have three peaks separated, they all are interacting with the surface the stationary phase in a different way to a different different extent, the one that comes out first the peak comes out first was the least retained, they did not have much interaction with the stationary phase, the peak that comes out last is the most retained in those cases. And the idea is to have them separated in that column and sent one at a time to the mass spectrometer. So the process of retention of the sample components, the analytes is determined by the choice of the column packing. In most cases, the silica is pretty much the same. People will sometimes buy a column from vendor one, it\u0026rsquo;s a C 18. And all the specs look the same to buy the same column from vendor two and it behaves differently and they will the vendors have their own tricks they do certain key things and so I see a T does not see it and see it but how the vendor has prepared the column may give you different results. They may be subtle differences or there may be major differences. So don\u0026rsquo;t assume that all ca teens are all mamita purples are the same So here\u0026rsquo;s an LCMS system, simple situation or even whether it could be a UV detector, and we zoom in and see that there are particles, they are often spherical. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;re not spherical, you will need to get in all those details with a tightly packed column with no significant voids, if you will, and the column inside diameters are can range from what they used to be 4.6 millimeter, they still are available, and they the optimal mobile phase flow rate is 1,000,001 milliliter per minute. The ones we prefer in favor of the 2.1 millimeter ID, why are these fractions that just the stainless steel is not made by the vendor that makes the columns they buy the stainless steel tubing from from some company, and that happens to be what the inside diameter is, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to make a 2.1 millimeter ID. They\u0026rsquo;re also a 1.1 millimeter ID there are 300 microns or often 320 micron IDs is moving towards capillary columns, if you will. And finally, the nanoscale columns at 75 microns, operating it to use the 200 micro nano liters Well, while 100 to 200 Nano liters per minute, which is 1000 times less than 200 microliters per minute. All these are amenable to LCMS. But the vast majority of folks that don\u0026rsquo;t do in conventional LCMS, use 2.1 millimeter. As I mentioned yesterday, the only reason the driving reason to use a smaller inside diameter is under electrospray conditions where you want more sensitivity. Here\u0026rsquo;s a question for you. Is there any benefit using a PCI if you if you\u0026rsquo;re looking at steroids and a PCI works well for you? Can you gain sensitivity by going to smaller and smaller ID columns? No, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t buy you a thing normals no one, there\u0026rsquo;s no justifiable reason for using smallbore columns for a PCI 2.1 Thank you very much works just fine. Some people will even use 4.6 million at millimeter millimeters ID at a mil per minute. So a PCI does not benefit from nanoscale chromatography, the length of the column, the longer it is up to 25 centimeters, the more theoretical plates more separating power, but the back pressure will be higher, and the runtime will be longer. Short columns three to five centimeters give fewer plates, lower back pressure and shorter run times. So it depends on what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to do next door with our CRO with lots and lots of samples we want short runtimes even less than a minute if possible. So we generally use very short columns as in to two centimeters to three centimeters something like that, because you cycle time for per sample a per plate is going to be much less mobile phases. The mass spectrometer does not like drinking from a firehose, the preferred flow rate is point two to a half mil per minute, that\u0026rsquo;s 200 microliters to 500 microliters per minute. The flow rate is usually dictated by the column inside diameter. As I said 2.1 millimeter ID columns are preferred. And that works very nicely in this range. The longer the column the better the separation, but the longer the runtime obviously. mobile phase solvent, they also the solid in the in the column is called a mobile phase. And that term determines what the spray solvent is a coarse solvent mixture containing water and methanol or st nitrile. The higher the percentage organic solvent, the better will be the I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, the higher the percentage the organic solvent the better but this will reduce the separation. Why methanol is a strong solvent and reverse phase it really eludes the sample the analyte quickly where water is a weak solvent, it has the less ability to elute sample off the stationary phase. And so it\u0026rsquo;s a compromise. And we often start with high aqueous so that molecules can be trapped on the column and head gift have them have time to separate as they go through the column. And we increase the methanol percentage through that gradient to induce them to eluded the other end of the exit of the column. Reverse phase columns and mobile phases, nonpolar columns and polar solvents. as I just indicated, we start with high aqueous and go to high organic and this is appropriate for those compounds that are quite nonpolar. They\u0026rsquo;re going to interact a nonpolar molecule like dissolves like ca tannins really nonpolar think of a wax. And that\u0026rsquo;s what your stationary phase is. So very nonpolar molecules will will linger reside in that longer than polar ones. It\u0026rsquo;ll go right through normal phase columns with just silica or use nonpolar solvents like hexane, hexane ethyl acetate, chloroform, usually it\u0026rsquo;s a very high percentage of hexane 98 97% With just one or two or 3% of the one of these other ones. gradient Lucian is not applicable not use a normal phase LC. And the compounds are typically very polar. For those for those applications do Ain\u0026rsquo;t Heavy ever, any of you ever use the normal phase column for LCMS hexane, for example, let me make a caveat. That\u0026rsquo;s really not any more something to worry about. But if you\u0026rsquo;re using APCI, and if you\u0026rsquo;re using normal phase chromatography with a 98%, hexane, and if you have a discharge needle with a spark on the end of it, should you be worried about hexane exploding. hexane is very inflammable. By the way, you\u0026rsquo;re using nitrogen, which keeps out oxygen, you need oxygen to have an explosion, and you\u0026rsquo;ve got an enclosed plenum housing for your source. So air from the room should not be getting in there. So it really is not a problem. But it could be if you were letting air in, or if you\u0026rsquo;re using air as a nebulizing gas. So you do have hexane think fire in the presence of a discharge needle, think needle mean think these are none of this is rocket science, but it means being aware of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. So you can do it these modern instruments can do it but be be aware that potential solvents, I think I showed this additives this sequence yesterday, list of common things, call them LCMS, friendly buffers and additives, common solvents, and things, no no\u0026rsquo;s things not to use, alkali metal phosphates, borates, citrates, inorganic acids, these are things not to use, you can use these or do if you\u0026rsquo;re doing HPLC UV, the UV detector just shines a light through a cell, you\u0026rsquo;re not doing mass spectrometry Oh, column selection, think I\u0026rsquo;ve touched upon each of the points I\u0026rsquo;ve made here. If the sample is chemically pure, a shorter column can be preferred one to five centimeters long. So I\u0026rsquo;ve covered each of those points, I think previously isocratic versus gradient isocratic, the mobile phase comp solvent composition remains the same, you start out with 5050 methanol water, and you don\u0026rsquo;t change it through the whole run. And that\u0026rsquo;s shown here in this graph with a constant percentage of methanol, for example, a gradient I mentioned earlier is analogous to temperature programming and GC, where you\u0026rsquo;re starting with a low percentage, usually of the strong solid, methanol might be only 10% methanol, but by the end of the gradient, that\u0026rsquo;s up to 90% methanol. And then at the end of that gradient, there\u0026rsquo;s a duty cycle time where you need to recycle the gradient before the next injection, you got the mass spectrometer sitting there waiting for the next injections. And you need to recycle, usually that can be done within a minute or two. But if you\u0026rsquo;re running 1000s of samples, that adds up. But it\u0026rsquo;s important to know you need to recycle the gradient, let it equilibrate, and then that\u0026rsquo;s when you make the next injection isocratic or gradient turns very important factors and parameters and LCMS. Why our mobile phase gradients use an HPLC a variety of reasons. Here\u0026rsquo;s an isocratic elution. And here\u0026rsquo;s a peek coming out in 70 minutes an hour and 10 minutes. If you have lots of samples or you\u0026rsquo;re impatient, that\u0026rsquo;s a long time to wait nice looking piece nice and sharp, but something is highly retained. Something is much more retained the nice species, eyes under isocratic conditions of 70% water and 30% of the scenic trail. If you do a gradient from 20 to 60%, that peak comes out now in 28 minutes and almost a third of the time. And both by the way, it\u0026rsquo;s gone from being broad to sharp, if you\u0026rsquo;re narrow, if you\u0026rsquo;re doing quantitative analysis, that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. If you are doing electrospray it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing because it\u0026rsquo;s behaves as a concentration sensitive detector, and the peak volume and that peak being narrow is is gives you a higher concentrations. So there\u0026rsquo;s two good three good things shorter runtimes narrow peaks are good sensitivity. And what I forgot what the third one was, but there\u0026rsquo;s at least two good things for doing a gradient like this and saving time basically. And you need a binary gradient system, you need to something more than infusion pump, you need a good pump that can do this. Reverse phase chromatography sometimes called RPC, the column packings nonpolar. CA, CA teen are common examples. Most popular mode, most people use it for everything they do whether it\u0026rsquo;s the correct or optimal thing or not. They just used to do it they maybe some people have never changed the column. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe that but they they don\u0026rsquo;t change them too often. Any other key points here I think we\u0026rsquo;ve covered each of these, the feature and one of the other courses I teach I show two chromatograms and ask which one is gradient in which one is isocratic? This is a gradient of course And what it does is give all the peaks are generally narrow if it\u0026rsquo;s an isocratic Run, maybe if I go back to that one yeah, this is a good example, notice how narrow and sharp these are, the lady looting one is broader. That\u0026rsquo;s a key chromatography nose can tell without being told that that\u0026rsquo;s an isocratic Run, because the last peak that comes out are the later pigs come out, they\u0026rsquo;re all broader, because you\u0026rsquo;re not compressing the peak by adding in more of the stronger solvent methanol. So that\u0026rsquo;s typical of a of a isocratic run. normal phase chromatography, it used to be called adsorption chromatography, because there\u0026rsquo;s no stationary phase is the interaction of the molecule with bear silica, silica think silanol think Si O H, and so ca molecules interacting with that. And so here\u0026rsquo;s a run in seconds, this is 54 seconds, so it\u0026rsquo;s less than a minute. For these molecules being separated. Pollen column packing is polar, like silica, a normal phase separations performed in I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say this is generally true. They\u0026rsquo;re not necessarily faster, shorter runtimes than others. The technique is useful, useful for for. For these aspects. You might ask why, or when should I use normal phase, if the molecule is water sensitive? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen too often in my world, but some people have water sensitive compounds. And if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, then you would not want to be doing a reverse phase chromatography, which always has water in it. If you have geometric isomers. That\u0026rsquo;s a weak argument in my view, because reverse phase can do that to sis trans isomers class separations, chiral columns, so chiral means you can separate enantiomer as mirror images of each other. I mentioned yesterday, I think that mass spectrometry is a chiral. And mass spectrum of two antibodies will be absolutely identical. Its mass spectrometers are great, but they can\u0026rsquo;t do everything. So we need that chromatography to separate those and send them one at a time. And so some of the good examples of chiral separations are done with normal phase chromatography. A good modern example is SFC Ms. Remember SS co2 is analogous to hexane and polarity. And so chiral separations by SFC are quite common. They\u0026rsquo;re often shorter run times faster, usually about a factor of three faster than normal phase. So those are justified justifications for doing normal phase chromatography. matrix effects is the big elephant in the room. I wish we didn\u0026rsquo;t have this problem, I have a dream of someday, there being a better ionization technique than electrospray, some electrospray urn Don Fen sharing the Nobel Prize, it\u0026rsquo;s a great technique has revolutionized LCMS. But I have what I like to call happy discontent. I\u0026rsquo;m happy with all the things that can do. But it irks me that I suffer so much for matrix effects, it causes lots of problems, I\u0026rsquo;d like to have a ionization technique that was not bothered by a matrix effects. UV is not bothered by you matrix X, Ei, electron ionization is not affected by matrix effects. If you can do a good separation, you can have normalized response. So matrix effects we have to deal with. That means co evolution of extraneous or endogenous compounds with your analyte, which suppress or interfere or sometimes enhance the signal most of time is the suppression of the signal of your molecule that kills us in quantitative analysis, we get a weaker peak than it really should be. And that\u0026rsquo;s an issue we have to deal with. And the best thing we can do is optimal sample prep and optimal chromatography. dilution of the sample is also advantageous. The opposite device that we talked about yesterday, and you saw briefly, a member of the solution to pollution is dilution. That is a significant dilution effect. And as long as it does not dilute it so much that we can no longer see it. That is the downside. If you over dilute, it\u0026rsquo;ll be so weak, you can\u0026rsquo;t even see it. But But dilution does minimize matrix suppression. And APCI. With its strengths and weaknesses is less susceptible. I cannot say that there\u0026rsquo;s no suppression, but it\u0026rsquo;s dramatically less than electrospray. So what\u0026rsquo;s really happening? Why does suppression take place? The endogenous molecule, the interferon is competing for protons with your molecule. And often there\u0026rsquo;s so much more of it, it wins out. And so your little molecule doesn\u0026rsquo;t get its share. I\u0026rsquo;m oversimplifying, but it does not get its share of protons. So we see less signal less ion current. That\u0026rsquo;s the why of matrix suppression. chromatography summary, choose an appropriate select selective stationary phase that favors the analyte and what I mean by selective it resolves them from interferences. chromate the stationary phase, it\u0026rsquo;s called alpha, alpha is the selectivity. A stationary phase gives you different selectivity. That\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s a proper correction. term some people misuse the term of selectivity. I mentioned yesterday on early postdoc that came to me with as a card carrier and PhD in chromatography. And he\u0026rsquo;s the one that changed five columns in a day where I would screw up all day long trying to change gradients with the same column and not achieve anything. And he could move peaks around by changing the column, enhance the stationary phase. So when you\u0026rsquo;re not getting anywhere, try a different column, and have a few not 100 of them on him that are not another ca teen what another stationary phase a little more polar, a little less polar. The optimum ID is affects affects the sensitivity and the flow rates, the LC conditions to serve the requirements of the project, that\u0026rsquo;s part of the method development. We met, we develop methods and then we often validate them. And you have, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to that, that I won\u0026rsquo;t go into. But you\u0026rsquo;re probably familiar with some of those aspects, ensure the mobile phase and conditions are not detrimental to the ionization mode. This is a marriage of two techniques. Remember the bird and fish it was not meant to be, but it can be. And if you\u0026rsquo;re married for very long, and I want to ask you how long you\u0026rsquo;ve been married or not married, you have to know what compromises means you have to suck it up sometimes. And at the HPLC has to suck it up and not use citrates. And the mass spectrometer has to suck it up and not take off two mils per minute all the time. It\u0026rsquo;s a marriage, that\u0026rsquo;s a compromise and yet we can make it work. You would like to have sharp, symmetrical and narrow peaks. They\u0026rsquo;re not noisy. We have a term. You know what a chick up LCP, it looks like a chicken head. You know, chicken has a comb A rooster, we don\u0026rsquo;t want peaks, I was bothered yesterday with with Li Fei pig, I would have done that. Again, I don\u0026rsquo;t like those bumps at the top of the peak, it should go up and come down like that. There\u0026rsquo;s reasons for it to happen. I think he had too much sample in that in that case. And so nice, smooth peaks without chicken heads. chromatography is a UV, there\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as noisy peaks and the early days of LCMS. That things didn\u0026rsquo;t work. So well. I think I mentioned we used to spray and pray that would work. And so it was often noisy peaks and chromatography. So I don\u0026rsquo;t want that technique. It\u0026rsquo;s comi peaks. While we now can do good peaks, if we know how to do it, right? Minimize a sample to sample runtime to achieve the sample throughput. If you have lots of samples, consider helix columns have any have ever used a healer column, these are relatively new. And they are good for handling upsample that has some very polar molecules and some in in the presence of flurry nonpolar molecules. And I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details of that. But it\u0026rsquo;s it could be worth if you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble with polar compounds that go right straight through your column and retained, then with CA teen, then you ought to try hillock it\u0026rsquo;ll work much better. These This is a article along 10 years ago and LC GC and maybe not a peer reviewed journal, but a magazine. So these are column myths that people generate their, their own ideas, one of the things that amuses me or, and concerns me is we have academic incest, and you must see it in in the laboratory like you have or are in commercial laboratories. I bet you saw it some so someone comes in. And maybe they\u0026rsquo;re an expert. They\u0026rsquo;re the were the company in the beginning. And they\u0026rsquo;re the LCMS expert. And they get second to renewing routine samples. So the company hires a new person. So the expert teaches that new person a technician how to do it. And then expert floats to the top and comes a manager or leaves. And now a year later, another new employee comes in and this this, this technician teaches the next person all the bad habit he or she has developed and the knowledge transfer just gets diluted and incorrect. And so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of the myths sometimes about what I what happens or how to do it right in the laboratory. And sometimes I wonder how they see Paul. But in any case, these are myths about HPLC. That is that you cannot reverse an LC column in the early days. columns that come along the way as columns came commercial columns developed in the mid 70s. So we\u0026rsquo;ve been making and better and better columns for years and an early days if you did reverse one other words, you connected the what was the accident as the inlet and it would disturb the bed and be a crummy column. But these columns today\u0026rsquo;s are very robust and it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly okay to reverse the columns as you connect them. This one is another one I addressed earlier that all CTN columns are the same they are not vendors do different things little tricks the way they do things, you will get different results maybe suddenly different but not identical results. Guard columns do not affect the separation. The guard comm is an insurance policy to protect and extend the lawn the length the life of a new column. They are usually about a centimeter long, they are a column they are chromatography and they do affect the separation and a minimally they also protect the column from really dirty stuff or party to kilohertz and so forth. So it\u0026rsquo;s a good insurance policy. Most people like to use a guard column. And in many instances, high temperature always leads to better separations, high temperatures of what GCMs. We have the column in an oven, do you have your column in an oven with HPLC? We do. But we don\u0026rsquo;t heat it to 350 degrees, the maximum was maybe 60 degrees, why would you put a calm in an oven? One, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t an air conditioned air conditioning and temperature, the room goes up and down, the retention times will drift you want the column to stay at the same temperature. So a common thing is to heat the column to maybe 40 degrees C, maybe 35, something above your room temperature, but keep it at that. So there are little devices caters that you can put the column in. The other thing is temperature does if you go to maybe 50 or 60 degrees, no higher than 60, the viscosity of the liquid reduces on a pixel sharpen up it looks like better chromatography, it\u0026rsquo;s not really better, but it\u0026rsquo;s because the solvent is viscosity is changing. And so the best reason, justification for heating the column is to have reproducible retention times. And that is an analytical benefit. That\u0026rsquo;s how GC fid that\u0026rsquo;s how you cold identify something and check the analytical standard has 2.5 minute retention time. And that\u0026rsquo;s the same as your unknown. So hence are the same. So it does not necessarily need the better separations. See 18 columns provide better separation and CA Not necessarily depends upon the molecule that you\u0026rsquo;re looking at CA is a more polar column data C 18. Not dramatically sold, but noticeably, so smaller particles and ultra high pressure always leads to better separations. Yes, if you do it right, you need to be a nano plumber, you need to have connections that are made correctly. You have seat the Sarah Farrell on the tubing. If the extension beyond the feral is too long, it\u0026rsquo;ll leak because your ferrets Pharaoh won\u0026rsquo;t see the using the correct Farrells is important as I said before, so if you have the if you have extra column variance is dead volume after the separation after the column on its way to the mass spectrometer having an umbilical cord this long between the column and the mass spectrometer is not good. Because you\u0026rsquo;re not you\u0026rsquo;re starting to lose your chromatography and by the way, the inside diameter of that connecting tube is very, very important because if it\u0026rsquo;s 250 microns instead of 100 microns is a huge viam you absolutely will have broadened peaks. If you have a long connecting tube to the mass spectrometer We usually keep them as short as possible after the column because no more chromatography takes place them. So if you do it the plumbing correctly, you do get better separations UHPLC columns plug more easily than conventional LC columns. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s not true either. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of the frets and how dirty your samples are. If you can plug this column you can plug a regular column plugging meaning there are particulates in your injected sample, hopefully not in your mobile phase. Have you ever noticed as a fret at the inlet tube in the bottom of the bottle that your mobile phases are all that is to minimize or eliminate particles from going to your system, silica gel base packings can be used only for pH two to seven. It used to be that if you had a pH of your mobile phase outside this range, you would destroy your column, they\u0026rsquo;re much more robust. Now it\u0026rsquo;s still a good idea not to have a pH of 14, or a pH of one on your mobile phase as you will eventually hydrolyzed or decompose your column. Paying attention to pH of the mobile phase is important but not as critical as it used to be modern columns should withstand at least 1000 injections. Yes, they can. But if you have really dirty samples, like some people can do, they will last for 20 or 30 injections, you can kill a column very easily with a few injections if the samples are really dirty. And an extra large volumes of samples added columns should always be kept tightly to prevent packing damage from contact with the atmosphere that used to be true. They\u0026rsquo;re much more robust. Now it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to have these little plastic nuts or fittings on your cap them but it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily necessary anymore. They will be good next week next month. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about two years from now. But the comments were much more persnickety in the past than they used to be. This was 10 years ago in this article, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s gotten even better since then. Wrapping things up, here\u0026rsquo;s the 16 PHS that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think you could do either AP psi or electrospray. If you take this kit that we have that you have, and look at the conditions we\u0026rsquo;re using water to see nitrile it\u0026rsquo;s 800 microliters per minute almost a milliliter per minute. We\u0026rsquo;re using a 4.6 millimeter column was 1.8 micron so it\u0026rsquo;s a UHPLC column. The gradient as shown here, we\u0026rsquo;re starting out zero time at 60% be mostly water going to 100 sent, and that stays until eight and a half minutes and then we recycle. It\u0026rsquo;s this time, a mile a minute and a half is used to recycle the gradient back to where it started. That\u0026rsquo;s an important step in a great edge and always need to recycle the gradient. The source is APCI. The consorts conditions are shown here. And under those conditions, you get this result. In about eight minutes, you get these peaks of all these 16 of these benzo these PAH is that we used to think you couldn\u0026rsquo;t do by APCI. It\u0026rsquo;s still a pretty impressive they can do this. The folks in the petrochemical industry are quite interested in these conditions. Another set of very different compounds cannabinoids. There are 11 of them, I think here that we are working with that are quite becoming quite important, quite popular. These are very nonpolar compounds, as I indicated before, they\u0026rsquo;re very sticky. I mentioned carryover yesterday. These are strong candidates for carryover, we have to be very careful admit from injection to injection. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list and 11 of them, their names, their masses, and so forth, and the fragments and so forth. And here is a chromatogram than selected ion monitoring in less than seven minutes for each of those Ben knee or postdoc who is now an employee has got this mixture down to less than three minutes by optimizing the the method development and using really good chromatography. And for those who run lots and lots of samples, a three minute run is a lot more desirable than a eight or 10 minute run. That brings us in to the end with the references Darnit I took more time than I intended to but those lessons those points in that lecture for those of you who are not just using somebody else\u0026rsquo;s already developed method, those are important things to questions to ask important points to be aware of as you go forward doing LCMS these references are relevant to some of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve covered.\n  \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;  "},{"id":134,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Advion-Courses/Lecture-06/","title":"Lecture 6 - Negative Ions MS - Electrospray \u0026 APCI","section":"Advion Courses on LC-MS","content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s begin lecture six. I\u0026rsquo;ve touched upon negative ion mass spectrometry. And I like to say there\u0026rsquo;s nothing negative about doing negative ions that could be dictated by the chemistry of the molecules that that\u0026rsquo;s the preferred way to go. There is an excellent reference that I just noticed I do not have in the reference list, I should add that in the future, that makes a strong point of how important negative IMS spectrometry can be. You can do it for electrospray or APCI, of course, as I\u0026rsquo;ve described, and the reason it has relevance is an acidic molecule such as a sulphonic acid is well suited to create a stable anion. If the molecule can be a stable ion ion, either in solution or in the gas phase, that\u0026rsquo;s a good candidate for negative ion detection. And the added benefit that I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned a couple times is that many of the chemical interferences, the other molecules that can cause chemical noise, do not respond to negative ions. So you will not see them even though they\u0026rsquo;re the baseline is therefore often low lower, and the interference from other molecules is less because those molecules do not support or provide negative ion detection. So your molecule in the presence of a base in solution will create a deprotonated molecule that\u0026rsquo;s an anion. And if it\u0026rsquo;s in that one that\u0026rsquo;s in the gas phase, it can enter the our inlet system over a mass spectrometer and B mass analyzed. An example about how positive ion produces ADOX. Here\u0026rsquo;s the positive ion. Example, methyl paradeen. Remember, the proton affinity of a nitrogen is high, so you can readily protonate such a molecule we have a nose plus h, but we can also have n plus ammonium ion and then plus sodium ion. So addicts in the positive ion mode are quite common. But they also do exist to a lesser extent in the negative ion mode. There are different kinds of addicts. If you have ammonium acetate present in a low percentage in your mobile phase, and you\u0026rsquo;re in a negative ion mode, you very likely will see an M plus 59 minus your mot like your weight plus 59 will be an eye on that you see as an addict. There\u0026rsquo;s not a lot that you can do to control that is a function of the chemistry. The kinds of molecules that really produce a lot of atoms such as this are those that are neutral with oxygens in them steroids, sugars, carbohydrates, many oxygens in the molecule, they tend in the presence of ammonium acetate, or ammonium formate. to form these addicts. Long ago, we did some work at Cornell with lipids, which are many of them are non nonpolar. And we had a trace amount of chloroform, we were doing normal phase chromatography with a small amount of chloroform when we saw m plus 35. Minus there\u0026rsquo;s there\u0026rsquo;s trace HCl and chloroform, you don\u0026rsquo;t usually know about it, it\u0026rsquo;s not real surprising to see it, but that little bit of chloride ion in the chloroform that was also a small percentage in our mobile phase, we saw an M plus 35. So if you have a source of an anion, a bromide, a fluoride, two, primarily the chlorides are the ones that you see the most. So do not be disturbed. If you see a negative ion detection, some addicts there are fewer numbers of them. And they will be different than they are in a positive ion mode. So negative ion formation iron molecule reactions, we are doing gas phase chemistry. As we reviewed, if we have a molecule and have a basic anion present, you can remove the hydrogen if it\u0026rsquo;s acidic. So this applies to acidic compounds. Remember that an alcohol like ethanol or and butanol or any kind of alcohol is not a weak acid, only one that oh, he has an aromatic ring. So it\u0026rsquo;s a funnel that then is a is a weak acid. So for alcohols will not do this. But this is a typical strong organic acid or carboxylic acid, and he can readily remove in the presence of base a proton to give you the carboxylates anion. I happen to remember that I think the molecular weight of benzoic acid is 122. Until you get to 121 charge transfer, we saw an example a couple of examples that were you have an ions created in solution in the presence of that your molecule which is neutral, will accept the charge. So that\u0026rsquo;s charge transfer, or charge sometimes charge exchange, it\u0026rsquo;s called two different things. And that can occur nucleophilic addition, it\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happening when you get that when you see that additionally, and the species here, the acetate ion the ducting to the this molecule, so that\u0026rsquo;s nucleophilic I feel like addition, and you can have nucleophilic displacement as much less common but you can actually with an eye and displace the A from this AB compound to be an anion. So again, that\u0026rsquo;s a form of trance charge transfer, but it\u0026rsquo;s caused by nucleophilic displacement. This happens generally in the gas phase and that spray poem. Well, those are four different ways and to produce anions and negative ion detection structures of nine drugs in a mixture. If you take a look at each of these, some of them are acids, this is endo indomethacin. And you can see it\u0026rsquo;s a carboxylic acid we look across here, that\u0026rsquo;s caffeine is not an acid albuterol is a phenyl. That\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s an example of an alcohol. That\u0026rsquo;s not acidic. But when the O H is attached to the aromatic ring, as organic chemists know, that is a weak acid. And so you could do that by negative ion detection. And you take a look at each of these as another acid. This is reserve pain, which is basically an indole alkaloid that\u0026rsquo;s a basic compound. Cortisone is a neutral molecule. If you were to do this in the presence of ammonium acetate and a positive ion mode, you would look very likely C m plus 18 ammonium ion, if you were to reverse the polarity of your mass spectrometer to negative ion mode, mono acetate is still there, the acetate from ammonium acetate, what a duct to this has got 1234 Or five oxygens. It\u0026rsquo;s the multiple oxygens that that supports the addition of an acetate ion. This is diarist of estradiol, a growth promoter. These are all drugs, and they\u0026rsquo;re different classes of compounds. I circled indomethacin here, because we\u0026rsquo;re going to take a look at how it behaves. This is electrospray ionization total and currents for positive and negative LCMS. So it\u0026rsquo;s all electrospray. There\u0026rsquo;s nine compounds in there. And under positive anti AIC for electrospray. We see indomethacin here, that same sample injected under negative ion conditions. indomethacin is one student. Yes, I said used to say glows in the dark, significantly better sensitivity. So one of the benefits and the reasons to try negative ion is it may be very well give you a much better sensitivity for a particular molecule. So this is kind of eye opening to see the differences in response. I think we in the lab, there was a question or I raised the question, there were a number of compounds present, but you didn\u0026rsquo;t see them all. So there are the same nine drugs are in this mixture. But you see easily three and maybe four way or the rest of them, they\u0026rsquo;re there. But they do not respond to negative ion detection. They\u0026rsquo;re not acids. So you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised by that. So that\u0026rsquo;s a very good question. Very relevant question. The LC conditions, the mobile phase was changed to induce or to pill civitate negative ion, we had either ammonium acetate or an acid up here to be positive i We need a source of protons an attic. And that\u0026rsquo;s I\u0026rsquo;m really glad you asked that I was going to ask it later. But it\u0026rsquo;s better that you ask it. And it\u0026rsquo;s very perceptive of you, we need to appreciate that when we switch what we\u0026rsquo;re doing LCMS non infusion not something else, when we switch to negative ion, we may, we probably need to change the mobile phase and therefore the chromatographic conditions. to favor the ionization we want, we need to have a base presence. So this these are different LC conditions. I don\u0026rsquo;t see them actually shown here. We had a summer student here from IIT one year, and I met her through the mentored her through the summer to it wasn\u0026rsquo;t rocket science, it was simple LCMS. And these examples come from that we made equal molar mixture of these nine compounds. And in a perfect world, you\u0026rsquo;d like to have them all be the same peak height, when you do LCMS, you\u0026rsquo;d like to see nine peaks all the same height in an area. That\u0026rsquo;s a dream, you don\u0026rsquo;t that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen in LCMS, the response drummer varies dramatically based upon the chemistry of the molecule. And other kinds of detectors. That\u0026rsquo;s not the case. And so in this case, clearly indomethacin is better done by negative ion if you want sensitivity. If you want to see more of those compounds, then you better be doing positive ion detection, you may be you need to do both of those experiments in sequence to see everything that\u0026rsquo;s present. So look at how much more sensitive indomethacin is in a negative ion mode. Positive or negative by electrospray. Here\u0026rsquo;s on the medicine, notice the Attucks here\u0026rsquo;s the unpolished H at 358. We see addicts, this is just a zooming in of the 357 358 you know the the isotopic abundance here is an inset showing you the details of the isotopes, but I want to focus on the X here on the positive ion mode but in the negative ion mode, we see very few virtually no addicts in in the negative ion mode. So in general there are fewer attics on the negative ion mode there are sambad in this case, fewer I also bring your attention this dimer we saw another example earlier when you inject too much sample it doesn\u0026rsquo;t not have If you do it optimally, don\u0026rsquo;t inject so much. But it will definitely happen if you inject too much sample, it interacts with itself in the gas phase, and combined is bound by a proton. So that\u0026rsquo;s a dimer of that molecule. positive ion formation on an atmospheric pressure come organization, it\u0026rsquo;s very important to realize that is not solution phase chemistry, the chromatography takes place with your analyte in solution, but we spray it into a hot plume, and in that plume is volatilize solvent, but also we want to volatilized your molecule in a very quick mode. And it\u0026rsquo;s in the presence of a lot of vapor. So the Leidenfrost effect is there, there\u0026rsquo;s some blanket of solvent around the molecule. But if it\u0026rsquo;s a particularly labile, fragile molecule, it can thermally decompose, but we do not protonate it and then unless it\u0026rsquo;s vaporized, neutral molecule, so reminding you what the heated nebulizer is pneumatic nebulizer with a corona discharge in the negative ion mode, we form this this, this dot minus if you will, and oxygen is key to that addition to the neutral molecule in the sequence of a gas phase chemistry takes place that ultimately gives you this species was rakes down to what you really want and what you actually see. And that\u0026rsquo;s in minus h minus ions are formed at this region right here, the heat creates the vapor the heat of autolyzed molecule, and when the ions form, they make a turn and go directly into the vacuum system, the initial vacuum system, but down here is the heated capillary that you\u0026rsquo;re adjusting the voltages to and heat yesterday. So here\u0026rsquo;s electrospray, versus APCI. The previous example was electrospray, and positive and negative, this is negative ion electrospray, versus negative ion APCI. And you can see it\u0026rsquo;s the same mixture of nine compounds, several of them are not seen because of what we mentioned before, so and didn\u0026rsquo;t know Matheson here that responds fairly well the negative that responds a little bit better but but fairly well also an in APCI mode. So comparing these two, either one, it looks like if negative ions is a choice you\u0026rsquo;re going to make either one would be suitable. These other molecules if you remember diaphysis, the best Ra was a DI phenyl weak acid, so you\u0026rsquo;re readily see that cortisone conform the attic with the acetate. Naproxen is an acid or carboxylic acid, and albuterol is also so that\u0026rsquo;s why we see these and do not see any of the others. positive negative mass spectra for indomethacin. Here is the m plus h 358. Without seeing the dimer in here, we see that there\u0026rsquo;s too much heat in the sprayer or the ion source, which can cause fragmentation that negative ion mode for this indomethacin was a lot of fragmentation here, a lot of experiments have been done in the past to differentiate is that due to the heat, or is it due to the ionization, I both of these API techniques are generally accepted to be very mild ionization techniques, they do not impart a lot of energy to the molecule, electron ionization and parts a lot of energy. If you remember, a typical carbon carbon bond is about 110 kilocalories fairly strong bond. And when we use AI, we use 70 electron volts. And electron volt is is a lot of energy. And it amounts to about 2200 kilocalories. So when we do AI, we\u0026rsquo;re hitting a molecule with a hammer, literally. That\u0026rsquo;s why it fragments so much in these experiments, it\u0026rsquo;s very gentle does not impart energy. That\u0026rsquo;s why people who would triple clouds use MSMS, you have them collide, the ions collide with occlusion gas, like a car going to a telephone pole. And something has to happen, the molecules fragment, we can do that as he did. In the lab, he described the INSOURCE Cid increasing the voltage to accelerate ions, I think that may be yet to come, we can make these ions fragment as if it was MSMS. It\u0026rsquo;s not really MSMS, because it\u0026rsquo;s not pre mass selection. But you can cause this fragmentation to occur in this case, so it\u0026rsquo;s not due to any MSMS due to too much heat. And as part of your method of development, as we discussed in the last lecture, it may include lowering the temperature too low. And also you don\u0026rsquo;t see this much fragmentation. If you\u0026rsquo;d suppose you were doing selected ion monitoring, you\u0026rsquo;re doing quantitative analysis, you want high sensitivity. And you want to monitor to this protonated molecule. This is a species, all the iron current is in that if you have these conditions, so you\u0026rsquo;re getting all this fragmentation. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to monitor just this ion and selected ion monitor, it makes perfect sense. But if you do that down here, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have much reduced sensitivity. All the ion currents spread out through all of these. So when you\u0026rsquo;re doing si M, you don\u0026rsquo;t want fragmentation occurring. You want all the energy that\u0026rsquo;s been used to make these product fragments, want them in the precursor Orion implies h. So as part of the method development, for high sensitivity LCMS quantitation, you want to make sure you do not have fragmentation occurring. And you do that while the full scan acquisition of the molecule, you might do it with repetitive injections by Fia, you might do it by infusion of a solution of your molecule. That\u0026rsquo;s really the ideal way of doing it. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t contaminate your instrument. Without that molecule, it\u0026rsquo;s in there all weekend because you\u0026rsquo;re sprayed to high concentration. And so you can systematically lower temperatures and energies to preclude fragmentation that would be part of a method development, optimization. And other important area that probably is not of interest to folks or in the roles that you have. But I mentioned yesterday, ion chromatography or ion exchange chromatography. This is generally used in environmental applications. It\u0026rsquo;s used to look for inorganic ions and cat ions, cat ions and anions, as well as some organic catalyzed anions. There are commercial companies in this country that the big the big giant is dynamics dynamics, which was purchased by thermal power is the predominant vendor for ion chromatography. This unit is made in Europe, and it\u0026rsquo;s MetroCount met metrohm is the name of it. We have one of those systems here. But it\u0026rsquo;s an ion chromatograph, I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the details of the mechanism. It is a form of chromatography, but not for organic molecules and drugs. It\u0026rsquo;s useful for large proteins, small nucleotides, amino acids, inorganic ions, and inorganic cat ions. And I\u0026rsquo;ll show some examples here. So these think of the Masseys member, we often do not scan down below 100 or 150. And here we\u0026rsquo;ve got ions as low as 19 for fluoride. So this is a chromatographic profile for ion chromatography mass spectrometry, in this case, selected ion monitoring. What are you going to? How are you going to fragment a fluoride ion? Do you expect to see any fragmentation from the void No. And so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do high energy or look at a full scan. So select that I am honored to even see I can\u0026rsquo;t quite tell the time axis here, six, six or seven minutes. But each of them is fairly well separated, perhaps with the exception of these two, but nitrate nitrite bromide phosphate, very nicely separated by Ion chromatography, you could not do that with a reverse phase column. These things go right through the column, and so the packing isn\u0026rsquo;t even there. So these are special columns and special chromatography. Here\u0026rsquo;s 10 parts per billion of fluoride in water, with a signal to noise ratio of 40 to one nice strong signal coming out in four minutes. This is the limited detection for perchlorate perchlorates, an organic anion that\u0026rsquo;s of concern and environment, large cities and industrial areas where this is in the drinking water or the environmental waters. And so you can easily do nicely do perchlorate. These are ions and solutions. So they\u0026rsquo;re not going to be retained by chromator conventional chromatography here that is diagnosed the best drawl. And this was an early part of my career in in New York state. There is a quite a cattle industry, agriculture and industry, a lot of cows and beef cows and so forth. And at the time, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to do very much detail there were this as an illegal drug. It was not allowed the USDA or the FDA. But some some of these drugs were coming in from Canada into Utica, New York, there was a slaughterhouse in Utica, New York. And this was being used by veal calf farmers, farmers to grow veal calves, the calves get to be just a few months old veal is a young cow as opposed to a fully mature cow. And the margins for or for success. Financial success are very narrow. If you give this kind of a drug to a veal calf, a week or 10 days before it\u0026rsquo;s slaughtered. It means a 20 to 30% increase in revenue to the farmer. And if the farmer has 200 of these animals as they gain in money, except that people in Europe, a few people in Europe and a couple of us died by eating an injection site of veal a piece of veal steak where the needle went in. And there was a high level of these compounds in that piece of meat and it killed some people. And so it was vehemently outlawed. And I was very involved in the early days of analyzing tissue, bovine tissue for diagnosis of Estoril. That\u0026rsquo;s all pretty much hopefully pass. I think the law tightened up on a lot of this. This happened back in the 80s. And it was quite a problem here and in the US. Also in UK. There has been some issues of people being told not to eat beef in the UK for things like this. But that\u0026rsquo;s a great content compound for negative ion detection. Daya soap is Tabasco. Let me ask Given an academic question that\u0026rsquo;s got two funnels, you could have vision have an NI and at each end, if you had were doing electrospray and had a Diana and you would have a a doubly charged ion. So would you expect you could see WHR Dionysus 268? I would look for something at 134. Do you think you can see that? If you did, would you predict as you\u0026rsquo;d see that in the mass spectrometer, you might in principle you could, but they\u0026rsquo;re so close together that they repel each other destabilizing. So one anion is more stable than two. So you generally do not see Dianna tons of small molecules like this, even though in principle, it could happen if you have a peptide with a long chain and the NI on one end can be a long way away from the other one, then you\u0026rsquo;re going to have W charged ions. So without I come to a list shortlist of relevant references on this material\n"},{"id":135,"href":"/docs/01-Mass-Spec-LC-MS/Part-03-Career-Development/Advion-Courses/Lecture-07/","title":"Lecture 7 - Normal Phase (Flash) Chromatography Couple to Mass Spectrometry","section":"Advion Courses on LC-MS","content":"So lecture seven, the last lecture or tomorrow these completely in the laboratory. This is on normal phase flash chromatography. It\u0026rsquo;s not obvious to me why normal phase chromatography is what is generally been used for flash. With all due respect memory, as I mentioned earlier that I started out as a synthetic organic chemist, synthetic organic chemist are not generally strong in analytical chemistry, which includes chromatography. So the original chromatography was normal phase, that\u0026rsquo;s when we reversed it. So I think they\u0026rsquo;re a little bit origins are from the past, and why they use normal phase chromatography. But historically, they\u0026rsquo;ve used that which means they use hexane. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the possible justifications as hexane is more volatile than methyl or then water, reverse phase. And you\u0026rsquo;re going to see that the flow rates are hundreds of mils per minute. So at some point, they have to get rid of all the solid they have to blow it off. And so a volatile sovereigns easy to get rid of the non volatile. So historically, normal phase chromatography has been used. And when you see here, flash, you should think preoperative column preoperative LLC, they\u0026rsquo;re prepping milligrams to grams of material, which is not at the analytical scale. And so they want to be sure that the peak that they\u0026rsquo;re collecting is what they think. And so in the recent past, mass spectrometry has been coupled with this approach to do that. And so there\u0026rsquo;s a mains that I\u0026rsquo;ll describe where the LC peak when it comes off, the UV detector sees it and triggers the mass spectrometer to start collecting. Otherwise, the mass spectrometer is sitting there not looking at anything, we\u0026rsquo;re going to switch the effluent from a column when the peak starts to show up, as indicated by UV detector, going to switch some of that to the mass spectrometer, so we know what it is. And that\u0026rsquo;s what the nature of what we\u0026rsquo;re doing here. More recently reversed phase chromatography has been introduced to this field. And people are starting to use that also. And I\u0026rsquo;ll close with that. So why combined flash with mass spectrometry? The simplest answer is to be sure what we\u0026rsquo;re collecting is what we want molecular weight and structural information. Mass spectrometry is well suited for good selectivity. It\u0026rsquo;s a good way to determine whether there are Co Co eluting components in the peak and LCP and you\u0026rsquo;ll see later that these are rather broad peaks, it\u0026rsquo;s large particle size is not UHPLC quality, it\u0026rsquo;s broad peaks that have large peak volumes. And so it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have another component colluding and you don\u0026rsquo;t know the difference. It\u0026rsquo;s buried underneath that peak, mass confirmation of the collected fractions to avoid offline TLC and work on other additional work. And certainly, if there\u0026rsquo;s isomers, involved isomeric mixtures, including chiral mixers that can be accomplished with the appropriate chromatography. So what is flash chromatography, very large inside diameter columns, remember, we\u0026rsquo;re focusing on analytical LCMS 2.1 millimeter ID columns, 2.1 millimeters, these are to to set to 10 centimeters, how much is 10 a column that\u0026rsquo;s inside diameters like that, you can drive a little car through a kid\u0026rsquo;s toy through it, big ID columns, large scale, if you will, the length of 10 to 30 centimeters 30 meter mobile phase, the flow rate, not 200 microliters per minute, but hundreds of milliliters per minute. So your your hat 500 milliliter bottle that you might have on your system is going to be a 10 gallon milk can I know some very large volume container, large volumes of solvents being used, solvent consumption is many liters per day. Not all bad. But that\u0026rsquo;s what you do when you do prep the chromatography is LC CMS compatible, not without total flow is no way we can swallow or accommodate 100 milliliters per minute, if you will. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to have an arrangement where when that peak comes off, we\u0026rsquo;re going to sample just a little bit of that flow, a tiny amount of cut from that flow. So mass spec versus other flash detectors or these others have in use ultraviolet, we\u0026rsquo;ve certainly know a fair amount about that response varies by the compound. And by the way, the compound better have a UV chromophore, a carbonyl carbon, a UV, a double bond, some sort of a chromophore or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t see it, it\u0026rsquo;s transparent. Not all compounds can be detected in it\u0026rsquo;s not as selective as some other detectors. There\u0026rsquo;s another detector you may or may not know about called LSD of aperitive light scattering detector. This measures photons scattered from semi and nonvolatile particles that have been dried of the mobile phase through evaporation. So you\u0026rsquo;re doing LC you\u0026rsquo;re in a way your flash volatilizing but instead of a mass spectrometer, you have this LC el el Less D, it\u0026rsquo;s more universal than UV, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to have a chromophore. It just needs to be a particle. It\u0026rsquo;s more consistent response than UV, so better direct relative abundance comparison, but it\u0026rsquo;s still not very selective at all any particle will be detected by that technique. And finally, mass spectrometry is applicable to a large broad range of organic compounds, as well as providing chromatographic data, it can provide the identification or confirmation of the compound. And mass spectrometry has a broad range of utility. But it\u0026rsquo;s not really truly universal, there are some compounds we cannot see if we cannot make an ion because of its chemistry, then we cannot see it. Ion sources, no API source is truly universal. Seeing all things equally, the selection depends upon the compound to be analyzed its structure and the ionization modes available. We know about the common historical sources of electron ionization and categorization, but they can only be used with a gas source like GC. And it\u0026rsquo;s hard to put grams of sample onto a capillary GC column for there used to be preoperative gas chromatography, it may still be done. But I it\u0026rsquo;s not very common. Gas chromatography is limited to a small population of the total organic molecule space, I once one around ask asking a question to three or four of the top chromatography that I knew in the world. And I asked them in terms of the total organic molecule space that includes methane to proteins, any molecule with a carbon in it, considering all those and by the way, you can derivatized to your heart\u0026rsquo;s content. In terms of gas chromatography, what percentage of that total population of molecules is amenable to gas chromatography? In other words, you can inject it, it\u0026rsquo;ll go through the column and be detected. And the general answer is about 20%. Not a large population. When LC came along, it took care of the rest. In fact, some of those that are really difficult to do by in that 20% can be easily done by LCMS. So you can see the origins of my press my, my precedent, my preference for or favoritism towards LC ms, it\u0026rsquo;s really amenable to a large number of molecules, although not all, liquid introduction sources, analyze over 80% of these compounds, including POLAR NONPOLAR biologics, meeting proteins and peptides, as well as some polymers. Using a variety of ionization techniques in our toolbox, including these that we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about. We\u0026rsquo;ve not talked very much about dark but you have seen ASAP API as atmospheric pressure photo ionization shining a xenon light on it, we do not offer that as a source it has been commercially available by Agilent, and one or two others, but it has fallen out of favor it it works, but it\u0026rsquo;s not convincing enough or successful enough, it\u0026rsquo;s not better enough than something else, to have people still aggressively buy it. I actually do not know I believe it\u0026rsquo;s still available if you really want one from from perhaps Sykes or Agilent. But I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen one or heard of one being sold in quite some time. The other techniques work equally well, that are some benefits, but they\u0026rsquo;re not compelling benefits to get people to buy it. So remember these ion sources that we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed this dundun but we have the atmospheric pressure colonization source, that is typically used for nonpolar compounds and not real high molecular weight, you must not try to do a protein or peptide or an industrial polymer that we have to have a vapor pressure and that it has ionization initiated by the corona discharge needle. In comparison, though, or the other tool is electrospray ionization, which is typically pneumatically assisted electrospray as I describe, which is very amenable to very polar compounds, any molecular weight because of multiple charging, the mass range of the mass spectrometer most all of them are no more than what we have the event mass spectrometer is out there with exception of time of flight. Time of Flight has an infinite mass range, if you can make an ion that has a singly charged ion, that mast 50,000 You could see it at a time of flight except in the no ionization really does it electrospray makes multi charges, which remember increases the Z of M over z and that slides the envelopes down into a regular mass range. And so most quadruples are now currently 2000 Like your weight, mass range. And so we can handle those kinds of molecules. Not necessarily because of the mass range the instrument but because of the benefits of multiple charging with electrospray. So which one of these interfaces was first to be commercially just a trivial task? I think I mentioned this yesterday. Which one was firstly, first commercially realized? I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about homemade devices like Leo. So who\u0026rsquo;s in any idea what Your that was remember what I said? I mean, this is not 2018 Was it 1990 was a 1985 The first one was actually this heated nebulizer APCI. The fundamental work was done in 1971. Before I had any involvement in this had Baylor University by a husband and wife team, Marjorie and Evan Horning, they did fundamental studies of APCI. At that time, very early on, they did not use a discharge needle, they use 60. Nickel 63, which is a radioactive emitter wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be very handy in most of our laboratories. And the first commercial version of that was a 1979 by sciex. And in 1984, is when electrospray was really brought forward by John fen and a bunch of us worked on it and the commercial availability that came about in about 1988 or seven something like that, just trivial details on the side. So APCI and electrospray, generally ionized by proton transfer, accepting of a proton or removal of a proton. This the first being with a base, the second being an organic acid ionization may occur by forming attics with other species and you\u0026rsquo;ve seen examples of ammonium adduction 18 plus 23 is sodium plus 39 is potassium plus 33. Is Andrea knows is now methanol and so forth the CNI trail is 42 a mass molecular weight of a sila trills, 41, proton bomb dimer is 42. So electrospray and APCR are good for most drugs, metabolites, aromatic compounds, large number of these kinds of compounds. APCI is best for generally small less than 1000, molecular weight, volatile polar and neutral, not real polar, but neutral compounds like steroids. And we need electrospray for these more challenging molecules, RNA peptides, proteins, sugars, carbohydrates, and other classes of compounds. Why is this APCI preferred for flash. It\u0026rsquo;s simpler mass spectra, the organic chemists these are synthetic chemists that have made a lot of this compound, they want to collect it. So the purpose is to profitably collect, isolate from the rest of the reaction mixture, large quantities, grams or kilograms of those molecules. And so they want something simple. They don\u0026rsquo;t want a complex mess aspect from to interpret. This technique is less prone to attics and fragments and dimers and so forth. Remember that proton bound dimers were seen with electrospray? We generally do not see that with APCI. Why might that be? Why might we not see proton bone dimers you inject a lot of sample. And with electrospray, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a proton bone dimer is the heat of APCI. Those proton bone dimers are not covalent bonds, they\u0026rsquo;re weak associations. They\u0026rsquo;re easily dissociated by heat. And so like thermal spray, no APCI has this heat and generally dissociates and they probably are they may be forming but we don\u0026rsquo;t see them probably because a disassociation by heat APCI is generally easy to do. Less solid dependence as ionization occurs in the gas phase, less matrix suppression these are reasons to prefer or lean towards APCI. You could do you can do this flash chromatography mass spectrometry with electrospray. But the trend is to use this technique. However, samples must be sufficiently vulnerable, the balance will be vaporized and thermally stable in the temperature regime of these temperatures. I showed this before the chemical space of what APCI covers it\u0026rsquo;s generally this range of molecules in here, polarity being on the x axis, and molecular weight being on the Y axis. So it nicely fits in this region here. And this is where organic chemists synthesized compounds. So it fits in there nicely. What are the solvent considerations? solvents that are compatible with aqueous APCI and electrospray? Include methanol, C nitrile, and a little bit of isopropanol. Are there any solvents that you really should not use or cannot use? I mentioned THF tetrahydrofuran. That\u0026rsquo;s often used chromatographically by industrial polymers, that synthesis of industrial polymers, the columns they use are generally not reverse phase. And THF is a favorite solvent that can be used. It\u0026rsquo;s not real friendly. It\u0026rsquo;s higher boiling point, the methanol seemed natural, but it can be used. So that\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine a common solvent that you should not use. chloroform can be used. It\u0026rsquo;s a heavy solid. Remember, it\u0026rsquo;s heavier than water, and immiscible with water. So there\u0026rsquo;s not any gotchas necessarily that I can think of. I did mention hexane be inflammable. You better make sure there\u0026rsquo;s no oxygen present when you\u0026rsquo;re volatilizing hexane in the presence of a spark sample countertrade Above 10 micrograms per mil increases the formation of cluster ions and may cause mastercharge intensity ratios to be unreliable. In other words, if you saturate them at saturate the signal the mass spectrometer, I think we saw a little bit of that yesterday in the group with Li, where the FIA peak looked like a chicken head that kind of detector goes up and comes down and then goes back up again you can saturate the detector, but you can also cause these dimers but you can saturate the detection system of the system. So less sample can be can be better. samples must be free of non volatile additives like EDTA phosphate buffers, SDS, Triton x, these are not friendly, LCMS friendly species, additives and buffers compatible electrospray and include the ones we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed before small acids, formic acid, and the favorite percentages, the point 1% or less, some cases even point oh 1% just a trace. more is not better. So here\u0026rsquo;s the situation that is the schematic setup. To do flash chromatography, Ms. Let me walk you through this. Here\u0026rsquo;s a giant chromatograph typically pumping at 10 mils per minute or 100 mils per minute, not 100 microliters per minute. And there\u0026rsquo;s a line a signal a wire going back and forth. So these two are talking the mass spectrometer, as it\u0026rsquo;s pumping, it\u0026rsquo;s going through a bow. This is a special valve, it\u0026rsquo;s called an MRA belt, mass rate attenuator it\u0026rsquo;s available from realigned is not ours. It\u0026rsquo;s a rapid switching Bell. The thing is obnoxious when it\u0026rsquo;s going, it\u0026rsquo;s going back and forth all the time, like this up here, click click, click, click, I\u0026rsquo;d like to put in a box and keep it quiet like quiet laboratory, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually switching. So why is it doing that, meanwhile, as this is going is going back and forth through this loop, and inside this box is the UV detector. So it\u0026rsquo;s a UV detector and a chromatograph LC column in the same box. And it\u0026rsquo;s normally running the effluent from a column through the detector and to waste a collection vial. But we\u0026rsquo;re going to put in series with that line. This this valve. And by the way down here, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have a delivery pump us SSI, that\u0026rsquo;s a manufacturer isocratic pump that\u0026rsquo;s going to deliver a CDI trail or isopropanol, or ethanol, with point one perform percent formic acid through this valve and to the mass spectrometer. So most the time two separate things are happening independently of each other. This LC is pumping 100 mils per minute going through the UV, and all of a sudden, and while that\u0026rsquo;s happening, the isocratic pump is pumping this mixture of sovereigns through the mass spectrometer, and it\u0026rsquo;s sitting there monitoring baseline monitoring nothing. But all of a sudden, through this wire, this red wire, the UV detector says hey, a peak is coming off. And that sends a signal to this thing to switch this valve, this MRA valve. So let\u0026rsquo;s look inside this valve. During this sequence as shown here, the liquid is coming into the valve here and going through this little line and back out of the valve to that detector. But when that UV signal says hey, there\u0026rsquo;s a peak coming out, This switches the MRA Bell switches so that the liquid is going this way now goes this way to the mass spectrometer. And it does that for a fraction of a second, it\u0026rsquo;s literally going like that. In fact, later it shows a 13,000 to one ratio is taking a tiny little sip of that 100 mils per minute, because we don\u0026rsquo;t want the 100 mils per minute going to the instrument the mass spectrometer, what\u0026rsquo;s going to the mass spectrometer is quite happy at 100 microliters per minute. So by sampling sweeping this loop with this one second aliquot, let\u0026rsquo;s say of this high flow that goes the mass spectrometer that goes back and forth like this. And can you imagine what the T IC looks like from the mass spectrometer, it\u0026rsquo;s got sample it\u0026rsquo;s got not got sample, it\u0026rsquo;s got samples not got sample, it\u0026rsquo;s a it\u0026rsquo;s a ragged peak, but we have software that\u0026rsquo;ll smooth that out and make it look pretty for you and I\u0026rsquo;ll show that in a minute. So the understand that concept, continuous LLC, too much to go through the mass spectrometer will want to peak shows up as indicated by the UV detector. The mass spectrometer says I\u0026rsquo;m here waiting, and it switches up valves and sends a little bursts of the mass spectrometer and we will get a chromatogram of that. So here are the experimental conditions for that. I love these these values, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at three Thalys not rocket science, just three simple molecules, and we got a solution. That\u0026rsquo;s one mil viam. And down here we\u0026rsquo;re going to inject a half a mil half mil injection. Normally it\u0026rsquo;s one to 10 microliters we\u0026rsquo;re injecting and so these these the sample has 1.2 grams per mil not micrograms per mil or nanograms per mil but grams per mil, there\u0026rsquo;s three of them, and so on we inject a half mil we\u0026rsquo;re essentially injecting loading a half a gram of each of these compounds because we want to preferably collect it. We want three vials that have pure individual satellites in them. Here\u0026rsquo;s the radiant conditions for hexane ethyl acetate and in this case, actually, it\u0026rsquo;s not really a graded Meiburg most most the time it\u0026rsquo;s isocratic. So the MRA Valve has setting and we use a setting of 38. And that means it\u0026rsquo;s the 13,300 to one transfer rate one and a half micro liter per minute. And so that continually switches back and forth and makes a fair amount of noise because it\u0026rsquo;s doing that an actuator. And that effectively is ultimately sampling from that high flow rate. I\u0026rsquo;ll remind you what these valves are down here. This is not in your manual, I just added this. But when we are doing a switching, we\u0026rsquo;re going from this position to this position. What\u0026rsquo;s the difference the samples returning the UV detector. In this situation, the sample is sent a small amount to the mass spectrometer Does that all make sense? Follow that. So here\u0026rsquo;s what you get a chromatogram. Though the three valleys the orange, orange trace T IC, is the THC from the mass spectrometer, the UV traces the purple trace, it looks a little better. The retention times are mirrored, if you will. These are the orange ones are not too ratty or noisy. You\u0026rsquo;ll see some others that are worse, probably because a large sample size of quantities here. Here is the T AIC here\u0026rsquo;s the extracted I incur profile for each of these, these are broad peaks, they\u0026rsquo;re point eight minutes, 48 seconds wide, if you will, these are the protonated molecules for each of them. So this can be done. This is what is done to do preoperative flash chromatography. Here is a normal phase flash analog output from from that system, the organic trace being in the T IC. And this is an eight minutes and not too long to run. This is what more commonly it looks like though, the T IC looks noisy like this, partly because it\u0026rsquo;s going like this as part of the time there\u0026rsquo;s no sample going to the mass spectrometer. And so AV Yan has the only mass spectrometry software for smoothing such a trace. Normally, I don\u0026rsquo;t like the smooth, because if you are normally when you have unstable ion current as a problem, like a spinning sprayer, or a restriction of some point, but in this case, it\u0026rsquo;s not the mass spectrometers fault. And we do this just for aesthetics, mainly, and if you\u0026rsquo;re going to do any quantitation, it helps to get accurate areas on these peaks. So here it would be the typical setup. For the analog output for the Fraction collector. I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on these details, but you should becoming familiar with how we fill in these boxes to tell the mass spectrometer how to operate when it when it goes. Here\u0026rsquo;s the three compounds again, the analog output is smooth to provide less noisy peaks. And here are the data after the smoothing come before these are the chicken heads I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned the often noisy at the top of the peak. That\u0026rsquo;s all by normal phase chromatography. More recently reversed phase large columns have been available. And so that can be amenable to other kinds of compounds. And here\u0026rsquo;s 50 milligrams per mil not a gram per mil of caffeine sulfa dot methoxy friends of yours that you may be looking at in the laboratory, the column is commercially available pure flash column, that\u0026rsquo;s the name of the column, the conditions and the parameters are here, the MRA valve is 11. It\u0026rsquo;s not quite as rate a difference mainly because the flow rates not so fast. And the amount of sample is not so large value and makeup is similar to what it was before. And so these are the conditions for reversed phase flash chromatography. And here you get a nice chromatogram. Again, the purple is the 254 wavelength the UV, the orange traces the T IC. So why do you suppose this UV detector shows a great big P for the same sample that the mass spectrometer receives and that signal is quite weak? Should you be should you worry about this? Is this a problem? Not really, it\u0026rsquo;s detector difference response. This compound has a huge chromophore the UV detector really sees it. Whereas the mass spectrometer, ionization it has proton affinity is picking up a proton but it\u0026rsquo;s not a bright molecule, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t respond that well, all molecules have a different response and the better the response, the better sensitivity. But here\u0026rsquo;s kind of a dramatic difference in the response to these two. If we look at this peak, the UV and the mass spec are closer together. And that\u0026rsquo;s because they behave similarly. So that\u0026rsquo;s not something we\u0026rsquo;re about you should appreciate that just different detectors. And again the reverse face flash. A total anchor and profile for these compounds are shown here. Two of them are just barely resolved the selfie diamond Hochstein itself and own but in each case on iced tea AIC and extract Nyan current and with this information, this synthetic chemists can be really confident that the peak is what he or she thinks it is. Finally, the near last slide, this is what such a system looks like. The mass spectrometer over here the MRA Val, the Fraction collector. That\u0026rsquo;s another thing after the mass spectrometer when it goes the sample cones off the column through the UV detector, it\u0026rsquo;s collected. There has to be a Fraction collector and we keep them often most injections are made and each injection is collected in the same test tube or sometimes Erlenmeyer flask because the volumes are quite large. And so we have quite a number of customers in the pharmaceutical industry in in pharma where the NCS remember those are new chemical entities that want to be drugged someday after $15 billion to put it on the market. These synthetic chemists are called medicinal chemists. I never I always kind of smile at that they\u0026rsquo;re synthetic chemists, but they\u0026rsquo;re medicinal chemists. When they go to work and more pharmaceutical company, and they\u0026rsquo;re our best customer for doing this. They are the ones that do flash chromatography. So with that, you\u0026rsquo;re we\u0026rsquo;re not done but you\u0026rsquo;re done listening to me, which can give you some relief way. I want to personally thank you for taking this course. And hopefully go back as real experts with your instrument.\n"},{"id":136,"href":"/docs/08-Sample-Extraction-and-Cleanup/Matrix-Effects/Matrix_effects/","title":"Matrix Effects","section":"Matrix Effects","content":"Ways of eliminating, reducing or compensating matrix effects:\nReduce the injection volume.\nDilute sample or extract.\nMore extensive sample clean-up and better extraction\nUse mixed-mode SPE.\nExtra wash steps in SPE.\nOptimize mobile phase (including organic modifier, additives, buffers, pH)\nEluotropic strength or elution profile [not understand].\nChange the column chemistry,\nuse longer column,\nuse Ultra Fast LC (UFLC) or smaller particles to improve resolution.\nSwitch from ESI to APCI.\nSwitch from positive ionization mode to negative ionization mode.\nExternal matrix-matched calibrators (i.e. standards with the same or similar matrix composition as the analysed sample) can be used to compensate for matrix effects. Internal standards (IS) can be used to compensate for variations in injection, sample preparation, instrumental parameters and also matrix effects.\nOther less often used calibration techniques are echo peak technique, standard addition, extrapolative dilution and (segmented) post-column standard addition.\nDefinition #  Matrix effects are defined as any change in the ionization process of an analyte due to a co-eluting compound; this can result in ion suppression or ion enhancement.\nThe co-eluting compounds responsible for this phenomenon can also be other substances than matrix components.\nMatrix effects are mostly observed in the beginning of a chromatographic run, since all polar and non-retained substances elute close to the solvent front.\nUntil today the exact mechanism is still unknown.\nMatrix effects are compound-dependent: a study showed that more polar analytes are more sensitive to loss of signal.\nMatrix effects depend on the matrix: as the complexity of the samples increases, more and more matrix effects can be seen. Considering the different working mechanism of the two most popular ionization interfaces, the mechanism of matrix effects will also be different for ESI and APCI. Several hypotheses on the mechanism of ion suppression have been formulated and will be briefly discussed here. For ESI, four mechanisms have been proposed: two mechanisms focus on the effect of interfering compounds on the ionization of the analyte (mechanism 1 and 4), the other two on the droplet formation and evaporation resulting in gas phase ions. Mechanisms 1, 2 and 3 occur in liquid phase, mechanism 4 takes place in gas phase.\n As described in section 4.2, at high concentrations, ionization saturation occurs. In samples containing interfering compounds, the limit concentration can be easily reached. At that point, the analyte of interest and other substances will have to compete for ionization. Ion suppression is caused by a limited number of charges on the droplet surface or more likely by analytes that are trapped in the centre of the droplet and will not be able to access the surface for gas emission (15). 2) Non-volatile compounds may precipitate with the analyte resulting in solid formation (27). According to the ion evaporation model, precipitates may also prevent the droplets to reach the critical radius and electrical surface field necessary for ion emission and thus limit the transfer of analytes to the gas phase (28). 3) Interferences can change the viscosity and the surface tension of the droplets, thereby reducing solvent evaporation and the ability of the analyte to reach the gas phase (29). 4) Droplets can be contaminated with substances which may evaporate as neutrals. If the gas phase proton affinity of these neutrals is higher than that of the analyte, transfer of a proton from the analyte to the interference may occur in the gas phase (20). APCI suffers less from matrix effects than ESI, since there is no competition between the analytes to enter the gas phase in ionized form (30). 1) Solid formation may be a mechanism of ion suppression in APCI (27). 2) Gas phase reactions such as described in ESI mechanism 4 may cause matrix effects (30). 3) The efficiency of charge transfer from the corona needle to the analyte may be changed by the presence of interferences (30). Although most research has been focusing on ion suppression, ion enhancement may also occur (26,31). Gas phase reactions for both ESI and APCI and changed charge transfer from the corona needle for APCI seem to be possible explanations for this phenomenon. Whether the result is ion suppression or ion enhancement, the co-elution of an analyte with interfering compounds can seriously affect precision, accuracy and sensitivity of a method. Therefore testing for matrix effects should be an integral part of LC-MS method validation, especially in forensic toxicology using often dirty samples. If possible, strategies to decrease matrix effects should be applied.  Solution #  Changes in five domains can eliminate, reduce or at least compensate for matrix effects and will be discussed here: the amount of sample, sample preparation, chromatography, mass spectrometry and calibration.\nAmount of sample #  Reducing the injection volume is a simple way to reduce the number of species competing for ionization. However, sensitivity is reduced. The sample or the extract can be diluted, again the main drawback being the decrease of limits of detection.\nSample Preparation #  More extensive sample clean-up and better extraction methods results in fewer co-eluting components and thus less matrix effects. In all papers comparing sample preparation, sample dilution and/or protein precipitation showed the greatest amount of matrix effects, while SPE and LLE resulted in cleaner extracts. Especially mixed-mode SPE, i.e. SPE that combines two retention mechanisms, was very useful to avoid matrix effects. When using SPE, the protocol should be carefully evaluated, since not only the analytes of interest but also interfering substances can be concentrated, magnifying matrix effects. To optimize the SPE procedure, extra wash steps can be added or the elution solvent can be optimized.\nChromatography #  Changing chromatography to reduce the degree of co-elution between interfering compounds and the analyte of interest can help in reducing matrix effects. Therefore, the mobile phase can be optimized: changing organic modifier, mobile phase additives, buffers, pH, eluotropic strength or elution profile may reduce matrix effects. Changing column parameters can also be effective for reducing matrix effects: for example changing column chemistry changes selectivity and using a longer column enhances separation. Moreover, when using columns with smaller particles or UFLC, resolution is improved, thus reducing matrix effects. Other researchers used LC/LC, i.e. the coupling of two columns with different retention mechanisms in order to achieve better separation. Generally, the higher the flow rate, the higher the level of matrix effects since more organic material requires ionization at the same time. Flow rate can be drastically reduced by using a nanosplitting device or a post-column split.\nMass Spectrometry #  In general, matrix effects are more pronounced in ESI than in APCI, so changing to APCI might help. The negative ionization mode is considered more selective than the positive mode since fewer compounds give a signal in the negative mode. Switching to negative mode may lower matrix effects. Of course, in this case, the analyte should be detectable in both ionization polarities.\nReferences: #  LC-MS/MS in forensix toxicology: What about matrix effects?

The presence of coextractives influences the analyte signals, which can be either suppressed or enhanced when compared to the response in pure solvent (Trufelli, Palma, Famiglini, \u0026amp; Cappiello, 2011).\nMatrix Effects in LC-based Methods #  Ion suppression is the most common matrix effect in LC-based methods, especially when MS operated with electrospray (ESI) positive polarity mode, which is the most used for pesticide analysis (Kittlaus, Schimanke, Kempe, \u0026amp; Speer, 2011). As described by Gómez-Ramos, Rajski, Lozano, and Fernández-Alba (2016) various causes are related with the ion suppression effect in ESI such as:\n(1) competition between matrix components and analytes for available charges and access to the droplet surface and\n(2) change in the viscosity and surface tension of the LC effluent that, consequently, influences the droplet formation and the evaporation process, affecting the number of charged ions.\nFurthermore, nonvolatile components can form solid analyte inclusion particles, and matrix components may act as ion-pairing reagents with already ionized analytes (Trufelli et al., 2011).\nHowever, the most discussed explanation is related to the competition for access to the droplet surface along with the competition for the surface excess charges (Gómez-Ramos et al., 2016).\nMatrix Effects in GC-based Methods #  As explained by Erney, Gillespie, Gilvydis, and Poole (1993) and Gillespie, Daly, Gilvydis, Schneider, and Walters (1995), for GC methods, the matrix induced response enhancement can be explained based on the competition between coextractives and the pesticides to access the active sites present in the inlet and chromatographic column. The coextractives protect the target analytes from decomposition in the hot injector.\nOtherwise, nonvolatile coextractives accumulated into the GC system promote the response diminishment because of the generation of new active sites (Gómez-Ramos et al., 2016).\nImpact #  The matrix effect impact is related to different factors such as matrix type, applied sample preparation method (Kittlaus et al., 2011), mobile phase composition (Gosetti et al., 2010), and also the geometry/design of the ionization source (Stahnke, Kittlaus, Kempe, Hemmerling, \u0026amp; Alder, 2012). Matrix coextractives can affect each commodity differently and can be observed in different parts of the chromatogram.\nResolution #  Many matrix compounds often have similar masses to target compounds, and in the case of coelution of matrix compounds with analytes, the instrument might not be capable of fully resolving these two slightly different masses. Resolving power is an important factor in the correct identification of these compounds, especially in complex matrices. TOF instruments usually provide resolutions of up to 15,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM).\nReference #  p134, Applications in High Resolution Mass Spectrometrey Food Safety and Pesticide Residue Analysis, edited by Roberto Romero-González, ©2017 ELSEVIER.\n"},{"id":138,"href":"/docs/08-Sample-Extraction-and-Cleanup/Matrix-Effects/Matrix_effects_evaluation/","title":"Matrix Effects Evaluation","section":"Matrix Effects","content":"Evaluation Approaches: #  \r\rFigure 1: Schematic overview of two strategies to evaluate matrix effects.

Despite the advantages of the technique, the complexity of LC–MS systems often leaves analysts struggling to meet method detection limits. In this installment of \u0026ldquo;Column Watch,\u0026rdquo; several strategies are discussed to improve method sensitivity through the reduction of contaminants, the careful selection of LC method conditions, and the optimization of MS interface settings. By understanding the relationship between these parameters and ionization efficiency, analysts can enhance their signal-to-noise ratio and realize the hidden potential of the LC–MS technique.\nIn mass spectrometry (MS), the term sensitivity can have several meanings that are often used interchangeably. Sensitivity may be defined as the change in signal per unit change in concentration of an analyte (such as the slope of the calibration curve) (1). More commonly, it is used to reference the magnitude of the signal produced by the analyte in the MS detector. In this latter usage, MS sensitivity is often used to compare detectors.\nFundamentally, the ability of a detector to provide quantitative data is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for an analyte. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined from the analyte S/N and is the lowest concentration of a substance where its signal can be distinguished from system noise (2). As shown in Figure 1, the higher the sensitivity of the MS, the greater the value of S/N for a given method LOD if background noise remains constant. Therefore, improvements in sensitivity can occur through manipulation of S/N. MS optimization, sample pretreatment strategies, mobile-phase composition, and LC column characteristics are all integral to ionization efficiency and will improve analyte signal when optimized. Likewise, limiting contaminants that contribute to signal suppression or adduct formation may also enhance response.\n\rFigure 1: A hypothetical demonstration of the effect of increased sensitivity on limits of detection (LOD) assuming linear calibration and fixed background noise\r\r\rMS Optimization #  In liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), sensitivity directly relates to the effectiveness of producing gas-phase ions from analytes in solution (ionization efficiency) and the ability to transfer them from atmospheric pressure to the low pressure zone of the MS system (transmission efficiency) (3). The optimization of ionization and transmission efficiency is dependent on the LC method parameters and the target analyte or analytes. To make the appropriate adjustments, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the mechanisms taking place within the MS source.\nElectrospray ionization (ESI) is one of the most popular ionization techniques; therefore, it will be the focus of this column installment. It is important to note, however, that optimization of the source parameters is necessary regardless of the ionization mode selected. As the LC mobile phase flows into the sample capillary, positive and negative ions are separated based on the polarity chosen. In positive ESI, the negative ions are neutralized on the capillary wall, and the positive ions continue with the mobile phase to the capillary tip where the charged analytes accumulate into a droplet. Under the influence of an applied voltage, a Taylor cone is formed (4). Electrostatic repulsion causes the cone to break up into small, electrically charged droplets, which then travel toward the sampling orifice under the guidance of the applied potential difference between the capillary tip and the sampling plate. As the tiny droplets progress toward the orifice, the solvent evaporates with the aid of drying gas and heat, causing the droplet surface area to decrease and an increase in charge density. Ultimately, repulsive forces overcome the droplet surface tension and the droplet explodes into even smaller droplets. The process repeats itself until the droplets are so small that gas-phase ions are emitted (5). The cloud of ions formed is known as the ion plume.\nChoosing the appropriate polarity is the first step in developing a sensitive LC–MS method. The capillary polarity is selected to match the charge of the analytes of interest. Typically, basic analytes will ionize most efficiently in positive ion mode by accepting a proton (M+H)+, while acidic analytes will produce the strongest signal in negative ion mode by donating a proton (M-H)-. However, it can be difficult to predict the best polarity mode for more-complex molecules. In addition, analyte behavior and response varies by instrument platform. Therefore, it is beneficial to screen analytes using both polarity modes during initial method development or when transferring an existing method to a new instrument (6).\nIonization efficiency is strongly influenced by flow rate, mobile-phase composition, and the physicochemical properties of the target analytes. The capillary voltage setting is dependent on the analytes, eluent, and flow rate and can have a significant impact on method reproducibility. The applied potential difference between the capillary tip and sampling plate is responsible for maintaining a stable and reproducible spray (7). Problems with variable ionization and precision can arise if the capillary voltage is set incorrectly. Optimal nebulizing gas flow and temperature are also eluent dependent. The nebulizing gas constrains the growth of the droplet, while charge accumulates and also affects the size of the droplets emitted from the capillary. The nebulizing gas flow and temperature should be increased for faster LC flow rates or when using highly aqueous mobile phases. Similarly, drying gas flow and temperature can be critical for effective desolvation of the LC eluent and the successful production of gas-phase ions. As a caution, when analyzing thermally labile analytes, care must be exercised to prevent their degradation in the source.\nThe location at which gas-phase ions are produced within the ionization source is important for optimal transmission into the MS system. The size of the ion plume is dependent on the number of fission events required to emit gas-phase ions and its distance from the sampling orifice. Sampling of the ion plume can be optimized by adjusting the position of the capillary tip in relation to the orifice based on the LC flow rate. At faster flow rates, the capillary tip should be placed further from the sampling orifice to allow for adequate desolvation and an increased number of fission events. Although extending the distance will allow for an increased number of gas-phase ions to be produced, repulsive forces will also increase proportionally, causing the size of the ion plume to expand and the density of gas-phase ions to be reduced. As a result, the number of ions entering the sampling orifice could decrease, causing a drop in signal intensity (3). At slower flow rates, smaller droplets are formed, allowing the capillary tip to be placed closer to the sampling orifice. Smaller droplets desolvate more easily and require fewer fission events, reducing the impact of repulsive forces and inhibiting the size of the ion plume. The decreased distance between the capillary tip and sampling orifice increases ion plume density and improves analyte ionization efficiency and transmission (3).\nOptimization of the ionization source parameters described above could potentially bring sensitivity gains of two- to threefold, as demonstrated by Szerkus and colleagues for the analysis of 7-methylguanine and glucuronic acid in urine (8). When optimizing the source conditions, it is important to use the intended LC mobile phase and flow rate. One method of optimization is to inject a standard solution several times, and alter a specific source parameter stepwise with each injection. Figure 2 demonstrates this process for the evaluation of optimal desolvation temperature for two pesticides: methamidophos and emamectin B1a benzoate. A 20% increase in response for methamidophos was achieved by increasing the desolvation temperature from 400 °C to 550 °C. In contrast, emamectin benzoate B1a experiences complete signal loss if the desolvation temperature is increased beyond 500 °C because of the thermal lability of that compound. Alternatively, source conditions may be optimized by teeing a constant flow of analyte into the LC eluent and monitoring the analyte TIC. This technique allows for adjustments to be made on the fly. Methods using gradient elution of multiple compounds should be optimized by estimating the organic concentration at the time of elution. Although this step can be overwhelming, the process can be simplified by concentrating efforts on only critical or low intensity analytes.\nFigure 2: LC–MS/MS optimization of desolvation temperature for (a) methamidophos and (b) emamectin B1a benzoate over four successive injections. Column: 100 mm × 2.1 mm, 3-µm fully porous C18; mobile-phase A: water + 2 mM ammonium acetate + 0.1% formic acid; mobile-phase B: methanol + 2 mM ammonium acetate + 0.1% formic acid; gradient %B (time): 5% (0 min), 5% (1.5 min), 70% (6 min), 70% (9 min), 100% (10 min), 100% (12 min), equilibrate; flow rate: 0.5 mL/min; polarity: ESI+; curtain gas: 30 psi; nebulizer gas: 45 psi; drying gas: 55 psi; capillary voltage: 5.5 kV; collision gas: 10 psi.\nSample Pretreatment #  Sample pretreatment is an essential part of the LC–MS analytical workflow, particularly when analyzing complex samples containing target analytes at low concentrations. Removal of non-target sample components can minimize matrix interferences and improve the S/N ratio for the analytes of interest. Matrix compounds coeluted with a target analyte may cause suppression or enhancement of the analyte signal; these interferences are known as matrix effects. Matrix effects often manifest as a loss in MS sensitivity or specificity, and are prevalent in ESI because of the potential for charge competition on the droplet surface prior to emitting gas-phase ions. As an alternative, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) may be employed if the analytes of interest are thermally stable and of moderate polarity (1). In APCI, the LC eluent is completely evaporated into a gas before ionization by the applied voltage of the corona needle. The ionized mobile-phase vapor then reacts with the analyte molecules to produce charged ions. Matrix effects tend to be less extensive in APCI, since ions are produced through gas-phase reactions instead of liquid-phase reactions (9).\nVarious sample preparation strategies are available to extract target analytes from potential interfering matrix components. The appropriate technique is dependent on the sample matrix, sample volume, target analyte concentration, and analyte physicochemical properties. If the sample is clean and known to contain high concentrations of the target analyte, simple filtration and dilution is a quick and convenient way to reduce the concentration of potential interferences. On the other hand, complex samples known to contain low target analyte concentrations will require a more rigorous extraction procedure to improve signal intensity. Although more stringent sample preparation procedures may not be desirable because of the cost and time investment required, injecting cleaner samples will decrease the likelihood of matrix effects from endogenous interferences while simultaneously increasing analyte response and instrument reproducibility.\nRegardless of the sample preparation technique chosen, it is important to consider that matrix effects can result from the presence of endogenous or exogenous substances. Whereas endogenous constituents are already present in the sample (proteins, lipids, pigments, and so forth), exogenous compounds are introduced into the sample during the sample pretreatment process. These compounds can leach from plastics used in centrifuge tubes, well plates, and pipette tips, and may include by-products and residues from the manufacturing processes (for example, molding agents, plasticizers, stabilizers, and releasing agents). The amount and type of contaminants varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, as shown in Figure 3a. In this experiment, contaminants extracted from polymeric solid-phase extraction (SPE) reversed-phase 96-well plates were compared for seven manufacturers. The extracts were analyzed by LC–MS, and the resulting data were background subtracted to remove contributions from the solvent and the analytical column. An overlay of the resulting chromatograms shows the presence of multiple chemical contaminants between the various manufacturers. The spectra for polyethylene glycol (PEG) was clearly identified in manufacturer C based on the series of repeating ions separated by 44 Da (Figure 3b).\nFigure 3: Contaminants extracted with acetonitrile from polymeric solid-phase extraction reversed-phase 96-well plates and analyzed by LC–MS/MS: (a) Overlay of background subtracted TIC from seven manufacturers. (b) Averaged spectra collected from peak C located at 6.5–8 min. Column: 100 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.7-µm superficially porous C18; mobile-phase A: water + 1 mM ammonium acetate + 1% acetic acid; mobile-phase B: methanol; gradient %B (time): 5% (0 min), 100% (8 min), 100% (9 min), equilibrate; flow rate: 0.5 mL/min. (Methodology developed by Hua and Jenke, reference 10.).\nOther sources of exogenous chemicals include glassware (especially when cleaned with detergents), the use of non-MS-grade solvents and additives, or careless work practices that can introduce chemicals from the skin or surrounding environment. Without appropriate laboratory procedures and careful screening of sample pretreatment products, it is possible to inadvertently introduce contaminants into a sample. If samples are subjected to a concentration step, a decrease in S/N ratio may be observed, because both analytes and contaminants will be concentrated (9).\nMobile-Phase Composition #  The mobile phase plays a key role in LC–MS sensitivity by influencing the retention and ionization of target analytes. The use of high-purity solvents and additives is of utmost importance to prevent unwanted adduct formation and increased MS background. Similarly, only ultrapure water from a water purification system or bottled water suitable for LC–MS should be used for mobile-phase preparation. LC–MS spectra collected for MS-grade and HPLC-grade methanol showed significantly increased impurities in the HPLC-grade methanol, particularly in the low-molecular-weight ranges common for small-molecule analysis (Figure 4). It is apparent from this data how the use of lower grade solvents could contribute to reduced sensitivity and convoluted spectra, making accurate quantitation or spectra interpretation difficult. Mobile phases should be stored in borosilicate glass containers and \u0026ldquo;topping off\u0026rdquo; solvents should be avoided to prevent the accumulation of contaminants.\nFigure 4: Comparison of averaged spectra for HPLC-grade methanol and LC–MS-grade methanol. Mobile phase: unmodified methanol as indicated; flow rate: 0.5 mL/min; system: LC–MS with ESI+ ionization; scan range: 100–2000 m/z.\nThe incorporation of volatile buffers and acids into the mobile phase enables control over the ionization state of the target analytes so that retention can be manipulated. Analyte retention affords the LC–MS analyst several advantages. First, increased retention of analytes means a higher organic solvent concentration is required to elute the analyte from the column during gradient LC. It has been shown that droplets with a higher organic concentration are desolvated more efficiently in the MS source, leading to improved MS sensitivity (11). Second, greater chromatographic selectivity makes it possible to avoid coeluted matrix effects that can be detrimental to analyte response. Areas of retention and matrix suppression can be monitored chromatographically by simultaneously infusing the analyte post column while performing an LC injection of an extracted blank matrix sample through the analytical column (12). Areas of matrix suppression are characterized by a decrease in analyte signal. In this way, analyte retention can be adjusted to avoid zones of significant suppression in the chromatogram.\nMobile-phase buffers and acids also affect ionization efficiency. This statement is especially true for ESI because it is susceptible to the reduction of detector response because of competition for ionization. To reduce the likelihood of buffer-induced suppression, concentrations should generally be kept to a minimum. Alternatively, mobile phases containing formic acid can minimize unwanted metal adducts. The excess in protons provided by the acid drives the majority of ion formation to the protonated molecule [M+H]+, resulting in an overall improvement in response since it would no longer be distributed across multiple charged species (13).\nEnhancements in ionization efficiency have been observed by donating protons in the case of an acid modifier in positive-ion mode or by accepting protons in the case of a basic modifier in negative-ion mode. The latter was demonstrated for the negative ionization of two neutral estrogens, estrone and estriol, where their response triples when they are prepared in diluent containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide compared to one that contains 0.2% acetic acid (14). Buffer salts containing ammonia (for example, ammonium formate or ammonium acetate) can increase the ionization efficiency of polar neutral compounds that cannot be ionized on their own by forming ammonium adducts. Ammonium salts can be used to prevent the formation of unwanted adducts by providing a constant supply of ammonium. For example, the LC–MS analysis of two cardiac glycosides, digoxin and digitoxin, is performed almost exclusively with ammonium formate modified mobile phases. Without ammonium formate, these compounds tend to form sodium adducts, which are difficult to fragment when analyzed by tandem MS (15).\nLC Column Characteristics #  The desire for increased LC–MS sensitivity has trended towards the implementation of highly efficient LC columns using smaller particles (sub-2 µm) in combination with reduced column diameters (≤ 2.1 mm). The introduction of superficially porous particles (SPPs) has allowed for increased efficiency while reducing system pressure when compared to fully porous particles (FPPs). High efficiency columns theoretically translate to improved sensitivity; however, LC–MS system extracolumn volume, ionization efficiency, and data sampling rates must be considered to fully realize the benefits.\nThe ability of a column to provide narrow chromatographic peaks is characterized as its efficiency (N), and is defined by its plate height (H). The efficiency of a peak is a function of its width and retention time. There are several processes that contribute to peak broadening inside and outside of the column. The injector, connecting tubing, and detector are all sources of extracolumn peak broadening.\nInside the column, eddy diffusion (A), longitudinal mass transfer (B), and mobile-phase and stationary-phase mass transfer (C) all contribute to peak dispersion. Collectively, these terms make up the van Deemter equation:\nwhere h is reduce plate height and v is the mobile-phase linear velocity (2). The van Deemter equation serves as a basis from which column performance is compared.\nOne way to increase column efficiency is by decreasing the particle size. Decreasing the overall peak width will cause an overall increase in peak height. Assuming that detector noise remains constant, taller peaks result in improvements in S/N and a boost in sensitivity. Additionally, highly efficient peaks are likely to be more resolved, reducing the likelihood that matrix interferences will impact ionization efficiency.\nSmaller-particle columns also allow for the use of faster optimal linear velocities, and by extension, faster flow rates-without experiencing significant losses in efficiency. Unfortunately, because of the mechanisms that govern ESI, faster flow rates are generally a detriment to sensitivity since all eluent must be removed for successful formation of gas-phase ions. Although some manufacturers claim instrument compatibility with eluent flow rates up to 1 mL/min, the best performance for standard flow LC–ESI–MS systems has been reported to occur in the range of 10–300 µL/min (16). To accommodate small particles and their associated high linear velocities, 2.1-mm i.d. columns have become the preferred size for standard-flow LC–ESI–MS systems with optimal flow rates of 200–300 µL/min.\nChanging the particle morphology is yet another way to improve column efficiency. Superficially porous particles are different from fully porous particles in that they have a thin porous shell surrounding a solid core. They are able to provide a significant increase in efficiency because of decreases in longitudinal diffusion (B) and eddy diffusion (A) that result from their narrow particle size distribution, reduced permeability, and rough surface exterior (17). Figure 5 compares the kinetic performance of a fully porous 3-µm C18 column to a superficially porous 2.7-µm C18 column of the same dimension using a van Deemter plot. The superficially porous column displays up to a 60% increase in efficiency over the fully porous particle.\nFigure 5: Van Deemter plot comparing efficiency between a 3-µm fully porous C18 column and a 2.7-µm superficially porous C18 column. Mobile-phase A: 45% water; mobile-phase B: 55% acetonitrile; detection: photodiode array, 254 nm; injection volume: 1 µL; sample: 0.03 mg/mL biphenyl prepared in 25:75 acetonitrile–water.\nUtilizing columns with narrow inner diameters minimizes analyte dilution, which takes place during the chromatographic separation. Because of on-column dilution, analyte sensitivity is inversely proportional to the square of the column inner diameter for concentration dependent detectors (18). Therefore, switching from a 2.1-mm i.d. column to a 0.3-mm i.d. column would theoretically increase sensitivity by a factor of 50, assuming the same volume of sample can be injected in both cases (19). Likewise, smaller inner diameter columns maintain the same linear velocity with reduced flow rates, which is beneficial in terms of ionization efficiency. The use of very slow flow rates (nanoliters per min) has gained popularity for applications that require high sensitivity with limited sample amounts. At these flow rates, desolvation becomes so efficient that matrix effects actually cease to be a concern (1).\nThere are several implications when coupling high-efficiency, narrow-bore columns with mass spectrometry. The decrease in column inner diameter, in conjunction with increased efficiency, leads to substantial decreases in peak volume. Without minimizing extracolumn volume in the instrument, column performance will be compromised, making it difficult to realize any significant gains in sensitivity. Most extracolumn-volume contributions can be attributed to the LC system with MS contributions being negligible. However, the tubing used to interface the LC column to the MS system was found to be critical since this tubing is located post-column, where the focusing effects that compensate for band broadening do not occur (20). As a rule of thumb, the extracolumn volume should not exceed one-third of the peak volume of the narrowest peak in the chromatogram (21). For example, a 1.8-µm, 100 mm × 2.1 mm column produces a peak volume of approximately 8 µL (16). Therefore, the maximum extracolumn volume should be \u0026lt;3 µL to negate system related losses to efficiency.\nSmaller peak volumes also imply that a fast acquisition rate is required to collect the minimum 15–20 data points across a peak needed for quantitative data. Time-related band broadening effects can result from insufficient dwell times and excessive data smoothing. In Figure 6, morphine and hydromorphone were analyzed using three scan rates (300 ms, 50 ms, and 5 ms). Artificial broadening is apparent for the 300-ms data whereas the 5-ms data show excessive noise that is characteristic of over sampling. Improper dwell time settings can have a profound impact on data quality and S/N ratios. When analyzing a large number of compounds, increased cycle times can be achieved by collecting data in selected-ion monitoring (SIM) or multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode to reduce the occurrence of time related band broadening effects. In addition, most software allows for timed data collection, enabling data to be collected for a particular compound over a predefined window of time, extending the cycle time of a system.\nFigure 6: Comparison of data collected with dwell times of (a) 300 ms, (b) 50 ms, and (c) 5 ms, and their contribution to time-related band broadening. System: LC–MS/MS; polarity: ESI+. Peaks: 1 = morphine, 2 = hydromorphone.\nConclusions #  Developing a sensitive and robust LC–MS method is a difficult task. Equipped with an understanding of the physicochemical properties of their target analytes, as well as the mechanisms and limitations of MS ionization and transmission efficiency, analysts can begin to make educated decisions to optimize overall response. The easiest and most effective way to improve sensitivity is through optimization of the ionization source conditions to ensure maximum production and transfer of gas-phase ions into the MS system. Careful selection of sample pretreatment procedures can reduce limits of detection by improving response and reducing interferences that could contribute to matrix effects and baseline noise. The use of efficient, narrow-bore LC columns, slower LC flow rates, and logical mobile phases can facilitate gains in signal intensity assuming extracolumn volumes are minimized and the data acquisition rates are appropriately set.\nReferences #  (1) R.K.

And if you come from the US, you know that everybody has to read at some point, when you\u0026rsquo;re going to school, a Herman Melville\u0026rsquo;s Moby Dick, and it\u0026rsquo;s about a whale. And I think this looks like a whale story. So I call this the Mobi peak, the great white whale. And we see this on our waters TQS system, very reproducible, sometimes for a whole batch where we\u0026rsquo;ve had a slight shift in retention time. And this lines up perfectly with where there is an end of a function, or what is called a period with AB Sciex. And so what it seems like to us is that when there\u0026rsquo;s especially when there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of functions lining up or starting, and it happens at a certain part of the peak, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a signal drop out, it\u0026rsquo;s like there\u0026rsquo;s a delay in passing of the signal from the mass spec to the LC, if you smooth your data, you will never see it. if you don\u0026rsquo;t smooth, you\u0026rsquo;ll see it now. And then the current version that we\u0026rsquo;re using Sen. 905 of Masslinks isn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to have that. But it does create some very interesting peaks.\nSlide: Narrow Peaks = Higher Efficiency #  Okay, so we always want narrower peaks, we say that\u0026rsquo;s higher efficiency is the chromatographic term used to characterize peak width, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear people talk about it either in units of time, or in units of mobile phase sometimes. And it\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple, narrower peaks are better than my peaks, it\u0026rsquo;s that simple, better signal to noise, lower quantitation limits. So this would be if you had the same amount of analyte, depending on things, how this is the same amount. But here it\u0026rsquo;s spread out. And I think you can, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of obvious that the skinnier peak is going to give you a better detection limits about the only time you can have it too narrow if your mass spec can\u0026rsquo;t scan fast enough. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about what that might look like. And also, of course, it\u0026rsquo;s going to give you the potential for better resolution. So this is the situation where it\u0026rsquo;s clearly not acceptable for quantitation. In here, it\u0026rsquo;s baseline resolved, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any difference and selectivity, both pigs are still coming out at exactly the same retention time. But we\u0026rsquo;ve had an improvement in efficiency. And so it gives us resolution. So of the possible things that can cause an abnormal peak, in my experience, it\u0026rsquo;s very heavily coming from the LC very just occasionally, is it going to be ms related? And I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of called it a sample prep faux pas, because if you did your method development work acceptably, then it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t happen from sample prep unless somebody makes a mistake. Okay, so what is wrong with these two peaks? How about this one on the left? Do you think that looks like a normal peak? What don\u0026rsquo;t you like about that peak? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong? Right, so it\u0026rsquo;s very angular looks geometric. Right? How about this one over here? Anyway, anybody ever seen that before? Took me a long time to finally realize what it is? This is too few scam that\u0026rsquo;s five scans across the peak? This is too many that\u0026rsquo;s 210 scans across the peak? And maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll you would know, my assumption is that essentially, you just have a lot of noise. I mean, so many things are arriving at that time that there\u0026rsquo;s variance, but signal averaging is not good enough over that shorter. Yeah, yeah. So this is like if you have a two millisecond dwell time or something like that, and it kind of fat peak. Of course, I, these were generated mostly by my mistakes, that\u0026rsquo;s where they get all right. So this is the scenario that we\u0026rsquo;re talking about, which is that our dwell time is set too long. And so what I want everybody to remember is that the mass spec, it has a short attention span, if you like, so it looks here. And then for the rest of this time, it\u0026rsquo;s looking at the other eight, nine or M RMS in this method. So here was MRM one, and then because it\u0026rsquo;s looking elsewhere, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t see what\u0026rsquo;s happening until it gets back and looks again and by this time, we\u0026rsquo;ve already gotten almost to the apex of the peak. Okay, so that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happened when your dwell time is not right. And this problem, I would say, is much more typical and much more of a problem than this. Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to just tell you right up front, this is not a dwell time problem, nobody changed the dwell time problem here. But that peak looks kind of like the dwell time is too long, right? So what do you think could be the difference here, if you can read the fine print, it\u0026rsquo;s too cheap. It tells you what\u0026rsquo;s there. This is the same vial injected when the problem was discovered, and then after the fix. So when you\u0026rsquo;re we always talk about duty cycle, right? I always felt like when I was first doing mass spec, if I could say duty cycle, it sounds kind of cool. You know, like I knew what I was talking about. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily really know what I was talking about. And here\u0026rsquo;s the issue, when we build a scan for a mass spec, we don\u0026rsquo;t just have dwell time, depending on your vendor, they might call it a little something. But in between the two MRM, there\u0026rsquo;s something where it\u0026rsquo;s flushing out the collision cell, right, it\u0026rsquo;s getting all the product ions from the previous scan out of the collision cell, so that for the next MRM, you don\u0026rsquo;t have any what we would call crosstalk you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything left for the last scan. So on a water stick us system, they call that an inter channel delay, then we often will build a set of m RMS as a function as a period, whatever it is, you\u0026rsquo;re grouping them together, right for what your purpose. And then at the end, there\u0026rsquo;s something called the Interscan delay, typically, or at least there is with a water system. So what happened here is that we our service guy was on site, and he was troubleshooting something. And he thought maybe the problem was the Interscan delay, and he changed it from point from three milliseconds to 100 milliseconds. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what happens when you do that. And if you look at this problem, now this axis is scan number rather than time, okay. And that\u0026rsquo;s where it really stands out when I first pulled this up, and I forgot that I had left it in scan number. I\u0026rsquo;m like, why that looks like they\u0026rsquo;re different retention times know, what this is showing you is that for this particular period of time, the mass spec was scanning. And here when the when the Interscan delay was set too long. That\u0026rsquo;s that flat top blue. So it\u0026rsquo;s only eight, about eight scans across the page. Okay. Here where it normally is. It\u0026rsquo;s now from about 40, to about 60. There\u0026rsquo;s about what 28 or something or at its hands across the page. So just want to point out that it\u0026rsquo;s not all about dwell time, this is a pretty unusual problem, but it can happen. The interesting thing is with this method, the early eluting peaks in our method were completely resolved. And so they only had a few scans and interesting, sorry, a few M RMS in the method. And so those peaks look normal. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until we got to a place, we had a bunch of overlapping ones. And so there was a lot of Interscan thrown into Interscan delay that this problem happened. We were lucky because I had seen it happen before otherwise, I would have been faked out by what? Why? How did that happen? Okay. So this is a normal. Normally what peak look like for one of our analytes and a calibrator. To me is Pam, if you\u0026rsquo;re not used to the presentation of data with waters, this is the quantifier, the qualifier and then the is the internal standard in peak review. So, what\u0026rsquo;s wrong? What\u0026rsquo;s wrong here? What\u0026rsquo;s going on there? This is an obvious one, come on. Why does it look like the, you know, a high rise building? Yep. So the texture is saturated, right? So this is a really classic appearance for those of you who use waters, you know that this 1.3 to eight as the limitation of the amount of signal. Okay, so that\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious. There\u0026rsquo;s too much to me. So Pam, somebody probably gave this person IV, Valium. What\u0026rsquo;s this? Why does this look like somebody took a bite out of it? So the retention time is the key. What do we know about ESI? Ionization? Is there enough charge to go around all the time? No, there\u0026rsquo;s not enough charge to go around. Right? We say that we have ion suppression. And so here what\u0026rsquo;s happening is the tomato Pam is causing ion suppression at the internal standard. Does that make sense to everybody? And it\u0026rsquo;s for a very limited part of time, it\u0026rsquo;s well this is eluding. So it starts out normal and then the tomato Pam comes up and the internal standards kind of, oh, I\u0026rsquo;m lost. I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough. I don\u0026rsquo;t get enough charge. And then as soon as this goes out, then it starts to be normal. Again. We see this a lot with methamphetamine too, because methamphetamine comes at such high concentrations. So this is obviously something that you need to dilute or Before you analyze it again. But does that make sense to everybody, when you see this odd peak shape, we always think of ion suppression is coming from the Matrix. But you can also get ion suppression from another analyte. In the method, sometimes we would see this odd shape, but you can\u0026rsquo;t see any matching peak that\u0026rsquo;s coming off. What would that say to you if you saw a shape like this, but there was nothing out saturated that was around what might be going on. When you design an MRM method, are you looking at every single thing that\u0026rsquo;s in your sample? No, you\u0026rsquo;re not. So what do you think might be going on? If you see that kind of a picture? So what could the matrix effect that\u0026rsquo;s what we that\u0026rsquo;s what we would often say is that there\u0026rsquo;s probably some other large drug like an antibiotic or something in there, that\u0026rsquo;s coming off at that time, we can\u0026rsquo;t see it. But it\u0026rsquo;s still stealing charge away from our peak that we want to measure, right. Okay, so I would say for mass spec, what you want to do is keep in mind that quadrupole acquisition MRM acquisition is discontinuous. Always keep that we think we look at smooth peaks. And it\u0026rsquo;s easy to forget that, that the MS is only looking for each analyte part of the time. So there\u0026rsquo;s only much time so much time to go around in the duty cycle. And then also when it comes to ionization, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a dog eat dog. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that it\u0026rsquo;s necessarily scientifically correct to say that there\u0026rsquo;s a limited amount of charge, and there\u0026rsquo;s competition. But that works for me to think about what\u0026rsquo;s going on with ion suppression. Okay, so this is normal. And now we see that what do you think\u0026rsquo;s going on here? If you\u0026rsquo;ve never had this happen in your lab, I would be amazed. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you this is this is when the guard column is new. And this is when the guard column has 700 injections going on. So what? Yes, exactly. Thank you. So this is an age column or guard column will look like that. And we first see the peak widen and then it starts to split like that. Age guard calm. I primed her to say that right. And so if you reinjected after you put on a new guard, if you do it the right way, then it looks good again. Okay, so if we\u0026rsquo;re talking about symptoms, we\u0026rsquo;ve now switched, obviously, to LC problems, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about symptoms of a degradation. One of the things that I like I like Russ Graham, all it says in his course, is the column is a consumable. And so we might think I can\u0026rsquo;t throw it away. And it has to be said, I have to make it last for 10,000 injections, we have to balance that with how it\u0026rsquo;s affecting the rest of our assay. So we if you have a peak asymmetry increase, if you have a peak increase with the loss of resolution that\u0026rsquo;s going to happen when you have aging of your consumables, same thing, I would say consent to retention time shift. And I\u0026rsquo;ve actually seen for us often we\u0026rsquo;ll see things come off a little sooner, the retention time is a little shorter as the column or the guard column ages, presumably, to me, because at the head of the column, you have all this matrix residue deposited. I\u0026rsquo;ve also seen this scenario where an early eluding peak might be affected, and other peaks in the chromatogram might not be affected. And that can be a little confusing, right, because you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t think it would affect the whole run. But it kind of makes sense, because the early eluting stuff doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily comes up sooner to the con because it\u0026rsquo;s not retained as well, right. So it kind of makes sense that it would be that one might be affected first. And the other thing I think that\u0026rsquo;s useful to know is look at the time course of the degradation. So this is how I think of it is to what\u0026rsquo;s going on, which is you\u0026rsquo;re getting some matrix residue deposited on the front. And this is an electron micrograph for the silica particles at the head of the column. And so you have both uneven flow and uneven partitioning into that stationary phase instead of that tight, narrow band that you want in order to get a good peek. So this is a testosterone assay that I was working on. And I had fixed one problem and I thought everything was great. And then I came back from coffee and I saw this so what do you think what could be going on? We already did column degradation. So you know it\u0026rsquo;s not that right as to be another choice. What might go on? I will tell you that I did touch the system. I did something to the system before I went for coffee. So what might have done that caused the pig to look like that? Yes, Actually, somebody did something with connectors, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t me to start with. I intervened. And so I ended up having to put a new fitting on there. And then the peak looked like this. So this was a long story of several people did things with plumbing. And one fitting was replaced. And as we talked about, there was probably a gap here. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what happened with the peak, typically two peaks about three seconds wide. Or the outlet of the column. That was, interestingly enough the outlet. I know I thought that was pretty weird. Actually, here\u0026rsquo;s the truth of the matter if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever worked with the waters, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of waters column manager we have. But it has this little short tubing. And it has this fitting that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a wrench. How do you Yeah, and so if you\u0026rsquo;re me, when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to hold that, you\u0026rsquo;re always turning the column manager off by mistake, and then you have to reset communications. So it\u0026rsquo;s really terrible to do. And the other fitting that\u0026rsquo;s hard to do is it goes into a post column valve. And essentially, you have to have a little teeny fingers to work there. So I changed the the post column connection because it was easy. And that turned out to be what was wrong, but most of the time it isn\u0026rsquo;t there. Okay, what do you think is wrong with this picture? There is something wrong with it. Let me make it easy for you. Do you think this one\u0026rsquo;s okay. That pig good? How many hands hands? How many people think that\u0026rsquo;s a good peek? Okay. All right. How about this bottom one? The internal standard? You think the internal standard picks? Okay. Okay, so kind of made it easy. So it must be this lag, right? What don\u0026rsquo;t you like about this big? Kind of spread out? Okay, so it looks like it maybe has a shoulder on it? Would you think if if if there was something wrong with the plumbing or something along like that, would you expect it to affect just one page rather than all three? I would expect it to. So this seems like something other than bad plumbing, I would say. Right there. That\u0026rsquo;s the problem. So if you inject the blank, or if we look at the blank that was injected with this batch, there should be no peek here. So right away, we know there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong, right? There\u0026rsquo;s an interfering pig. And so when we first saw this, I got worried that maybe something had happened with the system. And then I just did what we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about, which is I looked at the last batch, and I looked at the last set of batches. And what you see is that that peak has been there all along. So that was like bad method development on my part that we didn\u0026rsquo;t resolve this peak. But when the plumbing is good, that peak is separated, right. But this is the interesting thing to me like with the UPLC system. So this is the guard column. And when we took it off, this distance between the end of the barrel and the end of the tubing just like you were talking in your example, I have to tell you, to me, it looked okay, but it looked a little bit short. And so we redid the guard column. And then the chromatogram, it was like it was a misplaced barrel and a chromatogram went back to what it was supposed to be. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s one of the lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve taken away from working with a UPLC system, it can literally be microliters of difference or millimeters of difference. And you can have bad chromatography. So this is this is the inlet that I was talking about. This is horrible thing where you stick this non wrench there to hold it. And it has a peak barrel on stainless steel. And so the position of that barrel makes a big difference. And that one is too short, right, there\u0026rsquo;s a space between the barrel and the nut. And this one is correct. And that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that much difference really make a smear on the baseline become a peak when you correct it. So this is my personal favorite photograph. This is the one we talked about. It\u0026rsquo;s from step Science website. If you Google it, you can find it. So this is what you want to peak connection or in fact a stainless steel connection to look like right the tubing should be butted up right against, they call this the meeting port it\u0026rsquo;s in as far as it can go, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to get it like that it\u0026rsquo;s the first the this hard part is making sure it stays like that while you tighten the fitting down. And here there\u0026rsquo;s a gap, you\u0026rsquo;re never gonna see this gap. But this gap will cause you those kinds of problems that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing, right? That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to learn how to do fittings correctly. Okay, so the people in our short course saw this one already, so you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cheat and say. So this is an 11 component opiate method that we have it is I confessed a dilute and shoot method. And I\u0026rsquo;ve truncated there\u0026rsquo;s this big wasted space in here between 3.6 and five, but I\u0026rsquo;m showing you all the peaks there in a composite x I see. You can see something looks a little funny. And this is actually two injections, one from one day and one from the next day that are overlaid on top of each other. And if we zoom in, this is the earliest saluting peak morphine and this is the problem peak. And that\u0026rsquo;s what it looks Like after we fixed it injecting exactly the same vial. And the next two peaks. This is oxymorphone. And this is hydromorphone. And you can see that although this peak, these are the second injection is a little bit lower, the pink shape is really not affected at all right? It\u0026rsquo;s perfectly overlaid. It\u0026rsquo;s not that why. So what do you think could be going on here? Why is this? Why does this morphine peak affected strangely and not the rest of them? So we\u0026rsquo;re kind of in a plumbing theme anyway. What do you think? Do you think this could be a plumbing problem? How many people think this could be a plumbing problem? It\u0026rsquo;s just affecting one pig, the earliest saluting pig. Interesting. Nobody thinks it could be that. The whole bathroom obviously there\u0026rsquo;s like 3030 samples in the batch, all the morphemes looked like this. It actually turned out to be as far as we could tell a Warren Farrell all I can say is that when we looked at it, so this grayness, this is the one we took off, it\u0026rsquo;s just that it\u0026rsquo;s been in touch with the stainless steel, right? It\u0026rsquo;s a little bit my experience the edges of the How would you call that the mouth of the Farrell kind of get thinned out, it looks a little bit more rounded here. So all we did was replaced the peak Farrell, it could have been the position of the Pharaoh. And then it went to that I personally, that\u0026rsquo;s the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen that, that that small of a difference would affect just one pig like that. But that\u0026rsquo;s literally all that happened. We just replaced the feral and everything else was good with chromatography. So I think the other lesson that I would take from this is what happened that morning is that somebody had changed the guard column here. So we did not change the guard column. When we fix it. All we did was change the connection. But I think every time especially with a new PLC system that somebody touches a connection, you have to be suspicious that something might go wrong with it. Has that been your experience? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s that touchy. Yep. Okay, so minimize your extra column volume at the time of the LC install, I would not assume that the vendor is necessarily going to pay that much attention to it. Not everybody cares that much about extra dead volume. So you may have to interact with the service guy to to let him know that\u0026rsquo;s a priority for you. You need to know how to make good connections so that you don\u0026rsquo;t increase the dead volume, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna have to train people, peak fittings don\u0026rsquo;t last forever, they may be pricey, and so it makes you nervous to use it twice and then throw it away, but definitely they age. If you over tighten peak, it\u0026rsquo;s just going to last for a shorter amount of time. If you finger tighten it and then do a quarter turn that should be enough. I would advise you to buy pre cut stainless steel because it\u0026rsquo;s pretty hard to cut stainless steel on your own and figure out how to get stainless steel ferals to switch to tubing in the correct length like I was talking about. So for me, what I like to do with the peak fitting is slide it way back on the tubing first. And then when you\u0026rsquo;re putting it into whatever you\u0026rsquo;re connecting to you make sure that the tubing bottoms out because you want the tubing to bottom out and not the fitting. Then you move the fitting forward and you have to hold the tubing in while you\u0026rsquo;re tightening it sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s the hardest part, you need a third hand and then I like to tug on it a little bit to let let me know that it really worked. And remember to replace it. And this is everybody has their own favorite type of tubing cutter. But this is the kind I like how about you? Do you use that kind? The old fashioned ones with like just the actual razor blade in a in an aluminum block? Uh huh. Yeah, but basically, you want to be able to look at the tubing and have a perfectly flat and you don\u0026rsquo;t want an angle you don\u0026rsquo;t want the edges standing up. So I\u0026rsquo;m kind of saying the same thing that well did the maintenance calendar was anything changed how many injections on the column and the guard calm. This is the tracking that we talked about. Look at the peak shape of the last run for me if it\u0026rsquo;s slowly degrading, and you can see with our guard calm from injection to injection, how it\u0026rsquo;s getting worse, that tells you it\u0026rsquo;s probably a component is aging, if it\u0026rsquo;s sudden that suggests more that it was a bad connection. Also, we unfortunately seem to have a lot of edits made to our methods that aren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be there so check to see what actually happened if you thought you injected 10 microliters was it really tan or did somehow was a you know 100 Which actually wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be injected but too large of a volume and of course check this this system suitability test so that\u0026rsquo;s just what I talked about. If you have a lot of injections on the guard comm suspicious that it\u0026rsquo;s degraded if you have zero then probably it\u0026rsquo;s just a connection problem. Alright, so we\u0026rsquo;re close to finishing up here. What is What do you think is wrong with these peaks? This is the same same vial essentially sorry, it\u0026rsquo;s not true. This is the same standard injected here versus here. What don\u0026rsquo;t you like about this side? What is wrong with these peaks renting is everybody know what frontend means? That means this here, it\u0026rsquo;s not symmetrical. Okay, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of subtle, if you had all of them look like that, you might just find out that you, that\u0026rsquo;s how you design the asset, but it really should look more symmetrical. And so it was the wrong ejection matrix. This is a solid phase extraction for marijuana metabolite, it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be reconstituted with 7030 acetyl nitrile. Water. Instead, it was reconstituted with 100% of acetyl, nitrile. Okay, so in 100%, sudo, natural, essentially, the THC kind of likes the mobile phase more, that\u0026rsquo;s how I think of it. And so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t adhere in a tight band to the head of the column. So we had to re extract the whole batch, and then it was okay. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking at something that\u0026rsquo;s more nonpolar, like THC, glucuronide, we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the free acid metabolite there, it can get this kind of a fronting or even this, this is how bad it looks, you don\u0026rsquo;t even get a peak, you just get a blob, when the percentage of acetyl nitrile is too high. So sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ve talked to people at column overload, and I just wanted to they\u0026rsquo;re not so sure what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about. I just wanted to illustrate that a little bit. So if we do it, right, if we inject the right volume at the right, organic, we get this tight band, and then it forms a nice narrow Gaussian peak. If we\u0026rsquo;re going to inject too much volume, or if it\u0026rsquo;s too high of a percent organic, again, we\u0026rsquo;re talking reverse phase is our default, we\u0026rsquo;re going to see something like this fronting peaks, or wider tailing peak that sometimes has happened. And to me, this is really just bad design of your LLC and sample prep. So I think the I\u0026rsquo;m just going to step through these quickly, I\u0026rsquo;ll post these on the on the website as well. But my experience is that with a gradient analysis, you can\u0026rsquo;t just say, this is going to be too much organic, you really have to take into account your starting conditions on the gradient, your stationary phase, the inner diameter of the column, how much volume you\u0026rsquo;re injecting, and even your analyte. Because I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to inject like 70% organic or 75%, organic, onto a short column with a 2.1 millimeter internal diameter with a starting at like 30% B and I get a very nice tight peak because I really nonpolar, analyte, right, it really likes the stationary phase a lot better than it likes the mobile phase. And so you can get away with that. So I\u0026rsquo;ve often said people say, Oh, no, you could never do that. I personally feel that with gradient analysis, you should just try it, you just have to establish it empirically is that your experience that you can\u0026rsquo;t predict it. And the issue mean, of course, that you want more organic, because you want to get off, and you want to get your compound back off of the glass, or you have better solubility and more organic, but if the organic is too high, then you\u0026rsquo;re going to get bad looking peaks. So there are some rules for this, your goal is focusing on the analyte in a narrow band, if you have isocratic versus a gradient, that you have to take that into account. So for isocratic Rest grants rule is an ejection matrix of organic solvent that\u0026rsquo;s less than or equal to 90% of the mobile phase organic percent. So if you\u0026rsquo;re running at 40%, a pseudo nitrile, then you want your injection matrix to be no more than what is that 36%. And as I said, for gradient, I encourage you strongly not to say Oh, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly I\u0026rsquo;m starting at 30% V, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly inject anything more than 30% V, I think you absolutely can do that. And potentially give yourself a lot more flexibility. So what we talked about was column guard comm or online filter aging, and a filter can give you that same type of problems, not just the guard, or that you changed it and made a bad connection that you had new tubing or fitting installed post column. And that can also cause a problem wrong injection solvent or the wrong mobile phase, needle phase or column. So that\u0026rsquo;s about it. That\u0026rsquo;s a Picasso in case you didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize it and thanks for hanging in there into your lunch hour or whatever. Thanks very much.\nReference:\n"},{"id":144,"href":"/docs/04-Chrom-GC/Part-01-Theory/Injection/","title":"Injection","section":"Part I Theory","content":"Injection #  An important issue when selecting an injector is the properties of the analyte, such as potential for chemical instability, thermal degradation, or discrimination of high-boiling-point compounds within the injector.\nIn splitless mode, the split outlet remains closed during the so-called splitless period so that sample vapors are transferred from the vaporizing chamber into the column. Flow through the split outlet is turned on again to purge the vaporizing chamber after most of the sample has been transferred. Transfer into the column is slow (e.g., 30–90 s), resulting in broad initial bands that must be focused by cold trapping or solvent effects. Although splitless injection is \u0026gt;30 years old, the vaporization process in the injector continues to be investigated and debated.28,29 Splitless injection, however, is frequently performed incorrectly for a large number of reasons; vaporizing chambers can be too small, syringe needles too short, carrier gas supply systems poorly suited, sample volumes too large, needle technique inappropriate (cool versus hot) by slow instead of rapid injection with too low carrier gas flow rates, incorrect column temperature during the sample transfer, splitless periods that are too short, and liner packings at the wrong site.

Gas Leak Problems? #  \rTranscript\nHello, chromatographers, and welcome to another Restek Tip. Let’s talk about the importance of leak checking our gas chromatographic system. It’s advice that you’re given all the time – to leak check, and leak check, and leak check again. But why? Why are we given this advice all the time? Well, the fact of the matter is with a high-pressure instrument and numerous seals and connections throughout, leaks can always crop up in a GC instrument. So, we want to be checking for them on a regular basis. But then the question is, well, so what? What’s the big deal if I do have a leak? And the truth of the matter is it is a big deal. And in a few different ways.\nFirst, if we have a leak, we’re disrupting our flow path. That can result in loss of sample, poor chromatography, or other issues. So, we certainly want to eliminate those in order to get the best chromatography possible. But there’s another problem as well. Leaks can allow materials to get introduced into the system as well, especially compounds like oxygen. Why is oxygen a big deal? Well, oxygen is a pretty effective column killer and can damage many gas chromatographic columns. So, we certainly want to have a leak-tight system to get the most lifetime out of our GC columns.\nWhat do we do about all of this? Well, we leak check regularly. And ideally, we use an electronic leak detector. We want to avoid liquid leak detectors. Those liquid materials can get actually sucked into the instrument through those leaks and can contribute to contamination. So, that’s a little bit of why leak checking is so important. And again, the idea of making sure that we use an electronic leak detector regularly to look for those leaks throughout our instrument. Thanks very much for joining us for this Restek Tip.\nDiagnosing Leaks #  \rTranscript\nHi and welcome to this Restek Tip where we’ll talk about pressure decay tests for your gas chromatograph. So what is a pressure decay test anyway? It\u0026rsquo;s a test where you close off all of the means of egress out of an inlet in your GC and you pressurize it. And then you turn the pressure off. And what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for is, while you monitor the pressurized system, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to see that pressure drop because if it\u0026rsquo;s a truly leak-free system all of that pressure you created in there will have nowhere to go. And in some instruments you actually will see the pressure climb just a little bit. But if, on the other hand, you see the pressure begin to drop, well that means you\u0026rsquo;ve got a leak somewhere. So, the pressure decay test is a great way of not just trouble shooting a suspected leak, but also if you\u0026rsquo;ve done maintenance somewhere on your inlet or on the gas lines and you want to just reassure yourself that all of those points of connection are leak free then you can conduct a pressure decay test.\nLike I said, the pressure decay test is a great way for determining whether or not you have a leak. But, it won\u0026rsquo;t find the leak for you. That\u0026rsquo;s where having an electronic leak detector will really come in handy. Isolating where that leak is if it\u0026rsquo;s present at all. Now, to do an actual pressure decay test for your particular instrument you will want to consult your instrument manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s literature. This is a little known but very useful technique for ensuring that you have a leak-free gas chromatograph.\nFind and Eliminate Gas Leaks #  \rTranscript\nGas Leaks in Your GC System How to Find and Eliminate Them Featuring the Restek Electronic Leak Detector.\nEven a small leak in your GC or gas lines can result in the loss of sensitivity, sample, and valuable high-purity gas. A leak can also damage your column and instrumentation as well as contaminate samples.\nThe Restek Electronic Leak Detector is an essential tool for troubleshooting and routine maintenance of your gas chromatograph. It should be used daily to ensure that your instrument and gas delivery systems are in top working condition. Full instructions are available at www.restek.com/leakdetector but here is a quick overview of some best practices for leak checking and maintenance.\nPrior to leak checking a GC, we recommend that you increase system pressure while the GC is cool to accentuate any potential leaks and make them easier to detect. Then, after bringing the system up to operating temperature, be sure to recheck critical seals. You should leak check your gas delivery system and instrument, especially the critical seals, on a daily basis.\nThe septum is a common source of leaks. If the septum is leaking, simply replace it. By checking the septum regularly, you will be able to learn how long your septum generally lasts, and then avoid unplanned downtime by anticipating when to change it before it starts to leak. Incorrectly tightening the septum nut or injection port weldment after changing the septum and liner can lead to leaks. To fix a leak here, try loosening and correctly retightening the nut or weldment.\nFrequently moving the injection port weldment can crack the welding around gas lines. A leak can indicate that cracks have developed and that the weldment should be replaced. Leaks around the bottom of the inlet— specifically the reducing nuts, column nuts, and detector nuts — are common, especially since temperature cycling can loosen nuts that are not properly tightened. In addition, ferrules, especially Vespel-graphite blend ferrules, tend to shrink slightly after initial heating cycles,which may also lead to a leak.\nIf you encounter a leak near the column nut, reducing nut, or other threaded connection, first attempt to fully tighten the nut. After the fitting has been tightened, recheck it to confirm that the leak has been eliminated. Column connectors are common sources for leaks, even if they are leak-free after initial installation. Check them regularly during use. Reinstallation may be necessary if you discover a leak.\nDetector nuts from atmospheric pressure detectors such as F.I.D.s and T.C.D.s can also leak if improperly tightened or if a column breaks during installation. We do not recommend the use of a leak detector to check M.S.D. nuts because the vacuum draws in any leaking gases and prevents detection of a leak. Performing an air/water check using your mass spectrometer will indicate if there is a leak in your system.\nAs moving parts in valves age and wear, they can become another common location for leaks. Replacement may be necessary. After installing new gas lines, always remember to pressurize the system and check for leaks. Check for leaks any time you install new or replacement gas filters. If one of your gas filter compression fittings is leaking, check the fitting to make sure it’s in good condition. Then, tighten it appropriately. Afterwards, continue to routinely check around seals and fittings.\nLeaks aren’t always immediately near your GC. After changing gas cylinders you should also check around the regulator. Be sure to check any manifolds as well.\n10 Places to Check for GC Gas Leaks #  \rTranscript\nGas leaks are the bane of every gas chromatographer’s existence. Even the smallest leak can cause a loss in sensitivity, contaminate samples, damage columns and instruments, and lead to a lot of wasted time.\nIn this Restek Tip, we’re going to explore 10 places you must check for leaks to keep your GC in tip-top condition. Let’s get started!\nPrior to leak checking a GC, we recommend you increase system pressure while the GC is cool to accentuate any potential leaks, making them easier to detect. You will also need a leak detector. Today we’ll be enlisting the help of Restek’s electronic leak detector. These tools are huge time savers and are very effective in helping you troubleshoot and maintain your gas chromatograph.\nNow that we’re ready, let’s hunt down those leaks!\n1. The Gas Supply\nSometimes the leak isn’t immediately near your GC. Always check your cylinders, generators, and manifolds. Each of these should be the first place you check when you suspect a leak. Pay special attention after installing new gas cylinders, particularly around the regulator.\n2. The Gas Filter Connections\nCheck for leaks any time you install new or replacement gas filters. If one of your gas filter compression fittings are leaking, check the fitting to make sure it is in good condition. Then tighten it appropriately.\n3. The Shutoff Valves\nMoving parts can be more prone to leaking as they age and wear, so be sure to check the shutoff valves. A replacement may be necessary if you find a leak.\n4. The EPC Connection\nAll gases enter the GC through the EPC so it’s a critical spot to check for leaks. If you find a leak, ensure all the connections into the GC are clean and secure.\n5. The Split Vent Trap\nOften overlooked during routine maintenance, the split vent trap could easily be the source of your leak. Be sure to check that the fittings are nice and snug. A replacement might be necessary if the leak is still present.\n6. The Septum Nut\nAnother common source of leaks is the septum. If the septum is leaking, first attempt to tighten the septum nut, but only to finger tight. If the nut is not the source, try the septum; it may need to be replaced.\n7. The Weldment and the Weldment Lines Check the weldment for leaks. If you detect a leak, it may be the result of an incorrectly tightened weldment, if so, retighten it. If a leak is still present, or detected around the weldment lines, it could indicate the presence of cracks. In this situation, the weldment should be replaced.\n8. The Reducing Nuts Temperature cycling can loosen nuts if they are not properly tightened. If a leak is found, simply retighten the nut.\n9. The Inlet and Detector Column Nuts Be sure to check the column nuts and fully tighten them if there is a leak. A damaged ferrule could also be the source of the leak and might need to be replaced.\n10. The Column Connectors Don’t forget the column! Column connectors are common sources for leaks, even if they are leak-free after initial installation. Check them regularly during use, reinstallation may be necessary if you discover a leak.\nEven if a leak is not detected at any of these spots, it is good practice to inspect and leak check your gas lines and instrument daily, paying close attention to critical seals.\n"},{"id":147,"href":"/docs/04-Chrom-GC/Part-02-Application/Part_1_Restek_Retention_gaps/","title":"Part 1 Restek Retention Gaps","section":"Part II Application","content":"/* */\r.column {\rfloat: left;\rwidth: 50%;\rpadding: 5px;\r}\r/* Clear floats after image containers */\r.row::after {\rcontent: \"\";\rclear: both;\rdisplay: table;\r}\r\rPart1: Using Retention Gaps in GC\nJaap de Zeeuw, International GC Consumables Specialist, Restek Corporation\nGuard columns and retention gaps are used widely in gas chromatography (GC). Many users have difficulty understanding the difference between these two products, even though there is a significant difference in application. Retention gaps mainly are used for focusing the sample components when introducing a large (liquid) sample directly onto the column. Guard columns are used to protect the analytical column from contamination. When using a retention gap system, the retention gap will also act as a guard column, but its primary function is to create a focusing effect.\nGuard columns and retention gaps both must be coupled to the analytical column, and this connection introduces a potential point of risk. A new approach is to integrate the retention gap directly into the analytical column. By applying a “segment” coating technology the stationary phase can be deposited in a certain part of the column allowing a deactivated section at the beginning. Column coupling is not required and maintenance is greatly simplified. In Part 1 of this article we will explore retention gaps and build a foundation for a comparison to guard columns. In Part 2, we will review guard columns and discuss the new segment coating technology.\nUse of retention gaps #  In today’s laboratory, GC methods must be simple, fast, and low detection limits are required. Besides that, sufficient precision must also be obtained. It all starts by introducing the sample in the smallest possible injection band and making the band migrate through the capillary with minimal loss of the target components. With on-column injection a liquid sample is directly introduced into the capillary column as a liquid while the capillary column is kept at a temperature 10-15°C below the boiling point of the solvent. During this process the sample components are spread in an unreproducible way over the first 20-100cm of capillary while the solvent is evaporating. Parameters like injection speed, carrier gas flow, temperature of solvent and column, type of solvent, and pressure all will affect the injection band width. Additionally, when nonbonded stationary phases are used, the direct contact with liquids will result in a distortion of the stationary phase film and very short column lifetime. The majority of today’s stationary phases, like the Rtx and Rxi phases, are immobilized by cross- and surface bonding techniques.\nFigure 1: Retention gaps are used to focus components in a tight band at the beginning of the analytical column.\n\r a) Sample introduction: liquid film of solvent and sample are deposited in the first length of capillary.\nb) Oven temperature is increased (temp. program run): solvent and target compounds are vaporized and travel unretained through retention gap.\nc) When target compounds come in contact with the stationary phase, they are refocused on the analytical column, resulting in a narrow initial band width.\n\r\rFor proper application of the on-column injection technique, the use of retention gaps is essential [1,2]. The retention gap consists of a 1-3m length of deactivated capillary that is positioned in front of the analytical column. All the processes described will still take place, but now the components are distributed over the retention gap. When the oven temperature is increased the sample components will start to move (there is very little retention…that’s why it’s called a retention “gap”). When reaching the analytical column, the components will focus in the stationary phase resulting in a narrowing of injection band width (Figure 1). As these retention gaps are mainly used for on-column injection, the inside diameter is usually 0.32mm up to 0.53mm since the needle of an on-column syringe must be able to enter the retention gap. For coupling the retention gaps to the analytical column, we need generally coupling devices that can deal with different diameter capillary tubing.\nRetention gaps and splitless injection #  While on-column injection minimizes discrimination and provides the best quantitative data, especially for thermolabile components, it can be challenging to perform. Many laboratories will choose a splitless method for ease of use. For splitless injection we generally do not require a retention gap. The sample is injected in a hot injection port, evaporated, and transported with a carrier gas flow of approximately 1mL/min into the capillary. The amount of solvent vapor that enters the column per unit time is much smaller than with on-column injection. Although with splitless injection the oven temperature is also 10-15°C below the boiling point of the solvent, there is little chance of the solvent condensing. The high concentration of solvent entering the capillary column will cause a strong focusing effect for the components, generating a narrow injection band. If, in splitless injection, a method is used where the initial (injection) oven temperature is much lower than the boiling point of the solvent, the risk of solvent condensation (forming a liquid plug) will increase. This can cause unwanted broadening of the injection band. Coupling a retention gap will also fix this problem.\nWettability of the retention gap #  An important factor for good performance is the wettability of the retention gap surface. It is critical that the solvent spread evenly over the surface. This means that nonpolar solvents (hexane, methylene chloride, isooctane, benzene) require non/intermediate deactivated retention gaps and more polar solvents (methanol) will require polar deactivated retention gaps. If the polarity of the retention gap and solvent do not match, the solvent will form droplets inside the capillary. The carrier gas will “push” this droplet along the retention gap into the analytical column. The result is a broadened injection and possibly even peak splitting.\nRetention gaps for large volume injection #  Instead of injection of 1µl on a 1-2m retention gap, one can also inject much larger amounts on much longer retention gaps. Here we talk about large volume injection technique where retention gaps of 8-10m are used. Such retention gaps can be loaded with 100-200µl of sample. Injection must be slow to allow the solvent to evaporate while passing through the retention gap. With large volume injection, detection limits can be reduced a factor of 100. The technique requires some skill to optimize all the injection parameters. Additionally, the large volume retention gaps do pollute relatively quickly due to the large amounts of sample introduced.\nGuard columns and retention gaps are useful tools to the practicing chemist and it is important to understand the difference between them. In Part 2 of this article we will review guard columns and discuss a new segment coating technology that allows retention gaps and guard columns to be built directly into the analytical column tubing. This new technology eliminates column coupling, substantially reducing analytical problems related to leaks and dead volume.\nReferences #   Grob, K., Journal of Chromatography 237:15 (1982).

Although the best chromatography is obtained with \u0026ldquo;clean\u0026rdquo; samples, the practical situation is that sample clean-up procedures are minimized and relative \u0026ldquo;dirty\u0026rdquo; samples are introduced onto the column. Samples can contain particulates, heavy components, derivatization reagents, ionic residues, acids, bases… all these compounds can interfere with the stationary phase and they will influence the separation process. Usually the degradation of column performance is a slow process but it will happen.\nMost of the time the impurities accumulate in the first meter(s) of the column and by cutting off this section adequate separation is restored. Many users choose to connect a guard column in front of the analytical column. Such a guard column is deactivated and can be trimmed when contaminated and eventually replaced. Depending on the application, guard columns have a lifetime of 1 week up to 6 months. One has different choices for guard columns; a guard column can consist only of deactivated capillary, or it can be a coated capillary.\nDeactivated capillary tubing: Deactivated fused silica tubing can be purchased by the meter and then a defined length can be coupled in front of the analytical column. Upon contamination, a section of the guard column is removed. When the whole guard is \u0026ldquo;consumed\u0026rdquo; a new guard column can be coupled. The disadvantage of cutting parts off of the guard column is that the column becomes shorter and this may affect retention times. However, if a similar length is always cut from the guard column, the change in retention time becomes very predictable. A deactivated guard column will also result in band focusing. If the injection is not optimal, there will be a focusing effect similar to that of a retention gap.\nCoated capillary tubing: As the guard column needs to prevent contamination of the analytical column, a coated guard column can help as it has both the surface deactivation and also the stationary phase layer. The easiest and most economical way of using coated guard columns (or precolumns) is to buy two analytical columns. One we will use as a separation column and the second one will be used to make coated guard columns. From this second column we will cut 2m sections and couple a section in front of the analytical separation column. We can run our samples until contamination affects peak shape/response and then we can replace the guard with a new 2m section.\nThe system we have created will produce reproducible retention times as we always will replace the entire 2m coated guard column. Since the stationary phase is the same on the guard as on the analytical column, there will be no surprises. The coated guard column also will allow more aggressive samples/more contamination before it will give up. Lastly, we are able to cut 15 coated guard columns from a full 30m analytical column\u0026hellip;that’s also economical! However, if using a coated guard column, there will be no focusing effects.\nSegment Coating Technology Eliminates Problematic Connections #  Both retention gaps and guard columns must be coupled to the analytical column. While there are several types of effective coupling devices, all can create dead volume and can be a potential source of leaks and reactivity. Segment coating technology allows the retention gap or guard column to be built directly in the same piece of tubing as the analytical column, eliminating the connector and associated risks. This technology, available from Restek, is termed Integra-Guard or Integra-Gap and is based on the static coating method. In this process the capillary column is filled with a coating solution of stationary phase in a volatile solvent. The column is sealed on one end and on the other side a vacuum is applied. The solvent is evaporated and the dissolved polymer is deposited on the inside deactivated wall of the fused silica column. The static coating method allows columns to be coated by segment. When filling, for example, a 40m capillary with the coating solution, only 30m are filled. The first 10m remain uncoated, having only the deactivation treatment (Figure 1). This method deposits the stationary phase only in a designated portion of the capillary, creating the Integra-Guard or the Integra-Gap. The advantages of this technology are clear: eliminating the connector removes a potential source of leaks and reduces dead volume. Additionally, maintenance is faster and simpler since there is no manual connection to make.\nGuard columns and retention gaps are useful tools to the practicing chemist, and it is important to understand the difference between them. While they help protect analytical columns and focus samples, respectively, they are also a source of potential problems, such as leaks. Segment coating technology offers a better solution—integrated columns containing both the guard or gap section and the analytical column together in a single piece of tubing. These Integra-Guard and Integra-Gap columns are a simple, effective solution; they eliminate the risks of a separate connection and provide stable, accurate data.\nFigure 1: Static coating allows Integra-Gap integrated retention gaps to be built directly into the analytical column tubing\r"},{"id":149,"href":"/docs/04-Chrom-GC/Part-02-Application/Restek_Optimizing_splitless_injection/","title":"Restek Optimizing Splitless Injection","section":"Part II Application","content":"\rTranscript\nSplitless injection is an excellent technique for performing trace analyses, but to get the most out of a splitless analysis, it’s important to optimize your system.\nBut what should you optimize to get the best results?\nWe are glad to back for this Restek Tip, and we’re going to show you how to optimize your splitless injections to achieve high-quality chromatography. Let’s start with liner selection.\nChoosing the right liner can drastically improve both analyte recovery and injection to injection reproducibility.\nFor splitless analyses, you need a liner that maximizes homogenous vaporization, is inert, and has a tapered bottom.\nA single taper liner with wool, or a double taper cyclo liner are great choices.\nThe extra surface area from the wool, or the corkscrew, aids in vaporizing and mixing your sample with the carrier gas. It also helps to trap non-volatile material, protecting the column.\nLiner deactivation is important for splitless injections. The longer inlet residence times could lead to analytes interacting with active sites within the liner and inlet. Selecting a well deactivated liner reduces adverse effects from these interactions.\nLastly, the tapered design at the bottom of the liner helps to direct the sample towards the column and reduces contact with the base of the inlet where analyte breakdown can occur.\nNext, we’ll optimize the inlet temperature. You want the temperature to be high enough to achieve sufficient vaporization, but low enough to not cause excessive activity.\n250° Celsius is a good starting point, but you may need to adjust this temperature to achieve the overall best peak responses for your analysis.\nSo now, how do we optimize our splitless hold time?\nWell, you want a hold time that’s long enough to allow the complete vaporization and transfer of analytes to the column. But one that’s too long can cause excessive solvent peak tailing, leading to interference with early eluting analytes.\nA good rule of thumb is for the carrier gas to sweep the total liner volume between 1 and a half and 2 times. Restek’s EZGC Flow Calculator can calculate the ideal hold time range for you.\nAnd finally: initial oven temperature.\nSince splitless mode has a slow flow-rate, band-broadening will often occur as analytes diffuse within the inlet.\nTo help recondense these analytes at the head of the column you need a lower oven temperature, combined with an initial hold time that matches your splitless hold time.\nThe exact temperature to use depends on the volatility of your analytes. If they are relatively volatile, the initial oven temperature should be below or close to the boiling point of the solvent. If they are significantly less volatile than the solvent, higher initial oven temperatures can be used.\nThere you go. You’ve optimized your splitless injection and are ready to start your analysis!\nIf you have any questions, we’re here to help! Leave a comment below or visit us at restek.com.

How are they different? And which one should you use for your analysis?\nWe’ll begin with split injection, which is the most popular thanks to its versatility over a range of analyses. Inside a split/splitless inlet, you will find the carrier gas supply, the septum, the septum purge, the split vent, the liner, and the column. Now we’ll start the gas flow and simulate a split injection.\nLet’s rewind and go through what happened. First, the gas entered the inlet with a total flow of 104 mL/min. A small amount—3 mL/min—passed through the septum purge to reduce possible contamination from the septum, while the rest continued on to the liner. A fraction of the gas—1 mL/min—flowed into the column, but most—100 mL/min—is swept away via the split vent.\nThis ratio—the split ratio—is determined by the user before starting the analysis. Split ratios typically vary between 5:1 to 500:1, with the higher the ratio, the lower the amount of sample that enters the column compared to what passes out the split vent. During injection, the sample is injected into the liner and vaporizes. Since our example has a high split ratio of 100:1, one part goes onto the column while one hundred parts of the sample exit out the split vent.\nNow let’s look at an example of a splitless injection. In a splitless injection, the split vent is closed and left closed before and during the injection. As there is no split flow, the total flow is set at a dramatically reduced flow rate. Here, it’s only 4 mL/min. 3 mL/min passed through the septum purge, while the remaining 1 mL/min entered the column. During injection, the sample remains within the liner for longer before entering the column due to the lower flow rate. Once sufficient time has elapsed after injection, the split vent opens to purge the inlet. This duration—known as the splitless hold time—is calculated to be long enough to allow the maximum vaporization and transfer of analytes to the column.\nSo which injection technique should you use? It depends on the concentration of your desired analytes within your sample, the sensitivity of your detector, and any method requirements.\nSplit injection is ideal if your analyte concentration is high enough to afford an on-instrument dilution and still meet required detection limits. The higher flow rates through the inlet lead to sharp, narrow peaks, while simultaneously reducing the time for adverse interactions to occur. However, since most of your sample is vented, your detection limits are much higher. While this can be problematic for less-sensitive detectors, a detector with higher sensitivity such as an ECD or an MS/MS help make split injection possible.\nBut if your analyte concentration is very low, you may need to perform a splitless injection. Splitless injections excel at trace analyses. Since all the flow is directed to the column, you can transfer the majority of your sample. However, the slower flow rate into the column can result in the degradation of active analytes through adsorption and breakdown. It also leads to increased diffusion, causing band broadening.

Unfortunately, this is an area of troubleshooting where a lot of times we tend to take shortcuts. We might generate some bad data, look at a chromatogram and say something like, \u0026ldquo;Bah! That chromatogram is garbage!\u0026rdquo; That might be descriptive, but it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly helpful. What\u0026rsquo;s going on there? Why is it actually garbage? Do we have extra peaks? Do we not have the resolution we need? Maybe a problem with our baseline? What specifically is the problem that we need to fix with that?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where this idea of careful definition comes in. \u0026ldquo;Hey, I have these two peaks, here. They are not baseline resolved.\u0026rdquo; Great, that\u0026rsquo;s an actionable definition of a problem. What is also very important from that is it then will help us define what our fixed state will be. If I get baseline resolution on these two peaks, then I have fixed my chromatogram, and I\u0026rsquo;m ready to go. This illustrates why it is so important and beneficial to our troubleshooting process to take some time and carefully define the problem. It will allow us to limit and focus our troubleshooting, and get us back up and running as soon as possible.\n"},{"id":153,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-06-Instrumentation-Troubleshooting/Blank/","title":"Blank","section":"Part 06 Instrumentation Troubleshooting Guide in General","content":"Figure : \r"},{"id":154,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-06-Instrumentation-Troubleshooting/13_Leakage/","title":"Chapter  Leakage","section":"Part 06 Instrumentation Troubleshooting Guide in General","content":"Figure : \rGalak materials #  Leakage problems are usually solved by tightening or replacing pipe joints.

It is important to have a reference point when comparing high or low pressures to the norm. This reference point should be the pressure generated in the system when everything is functioning correctly. It is a good idea to note the system pressure under normal operating conditions each day or each time your HPLC is used. This will allow you to spot any pressure trends that otherwise might go unnoticed.\nPressure problems fall into one of three categories: high, low or fluctuating pressure. They can occur suddenly or be a gradual process. Sudden pressure rises tend to be due to particles from the sample, blocked or damaged tubing or column packed bed collapse. Gradual pressure rises can also be due to particles in the sample, but they can also arise from particles generated in the instrument, for example, debris from vial septa or degrading seals.\nBefore releasing any high pressure build-up in a system, be aware that the solvent may form an aerosol or spray when loosening connections.

Regeneration and cleaning of the HPLC column will improve the separation effect.\nColumn capacity decrease\nAfter a long time of usage, there are some strong retention components adsorbed in the column, and small injection volumes tend to have peak splitting. The problem can be ameliorated by cleaning the column with a solvent with strong elution ability or by just replacing the column.\nThe sample solvent does not match the mobile phase or the injection volume is too large\nWhen the polarity of the sample solvent is larger than that of the mobile phase, sometimes the peak deformation and splitting phenomenon are easy to occur even if the sample volume is small. It is recommended to dissolve the sample with the mobile phase.\nImproper mobile phase\nThis situation is rare.

This may be caused by the column block. Wash the column with mobile phase solvent or acid cleaning or other solvents in a reverse direction, the block in the column will be washed away. Forward direction washing sometimes also can solve this problem.\nIf the peak shape is trailing with little difference between two peaks, it may be caused by the dirty or loss of the stationary phase in the column header.\nSolvent polarity and injection volume  For reversed-phase chromatography, the common mobile phases are methanol, acetonitrile, and water. Other additives are added to improve the separation performance. The sample is generally dissolved in a soluble solvent with the mobile phase, and the best solution is to use the mobile phase. When the solvent is strong polarity reagent (such as pure methanol, acetonitrile, pure ethanol) and the analysis system is mainly water, the double peaks phenomenon will occur with a large injection volume of pure sample (such as quantitative tube for 20ul): a peak combine with a smaller peak (different every time) with a tail, the retention time (relative to less sample quantity) will be earlier. If the injection volume is reduced by more than half, the peak shape will return to normal. This is because the solvent polarity of the sample is too different from that of the mobile phase, the mobile phase has no time to dilute it to reach equilibrium.\nAnother reason is that the injection volume is not necessarily large, but the absolute amount is large, and the two peaks on the chromatogram are close together, basically at the same height, without trailing (if the peak appearance time is very short, it may also be a column problem). If it is caused by a large injection and overload column, dilute the sample before injection.\nSample characteristics  Some samples, due to the characteristics of their chemical structure, have the phenomenon of tautomerism, and the tautomerism can not be separated, but in a dynamic equilibrium existence. In the chromatographic analysis, under a specific condition, a substance will appear double peaks. These double peaks are very close with the same height and no tail. The double peak phenomenon will disappear when the condition is changed (especially pH).\nDevice parameters  The parameters of the record are generally set internally and do not need to be modified without special needs. The HPLC recording time is generally 5ms. If the recording interval is shortened, one peak will become two or more peaks.\n Column contamination Frit block Column head collapsing (liquid phase pH≥7). Choose special columns will solve it. Solvent effect. The solvent is more polar than the mobile phase. It is also decided by the sample injection volume.

The leading peak may be caused by column overload, and the tailing peak may be caused by sample contamination.

Also, avoiding sample diluent mismatch can tremendously help mitigate sample crash or precipitation. Sometimes adjusting the needle insertion depth to make sure the injector is drawing from the supernatant of the sample can also help prevent particulates from entering the column.\nColumn clogging from mobile phase can occur due to bacterial growth in poorly maintained aqueous mobile phase bottles and precipitation of buffer salts. In all cases, mobile phases should be freshly prepared with HPLC-grade solvents and capped. At times, normal wear of the injection valve rotor seal and pump seals also generates particulates that can clog the column packing bed. You can avoid this by simply replacing the parts as a part of your routine preventative maintenance schedule.\nFinally, using a guard column or an UltraShield pre-column filter, can significantly reduce the risk of clogging your analytical column. When using a guard column, make sure you always select the phase system that is designed for your analytical columns.

Guidance on diagnosing and solving common peak problems. Best practices for managing system back pressure.  Every instrument and every method will at some point experience a deterioration in performance that requires troubleshooting. When this occurs, the first—and most essential—part of LC troubleshooting is knowing what “normal” looks like. By carefully documenting instrument qualification tests, maintenance events, and system suitability results, you create an invaluable source of comparison that establishes normal ranges and can reveal where problems may lie. For example, rerunning a flow rate accuracy test and comparing it to previous values can help establish whether a flow rate issue is the root cause behind retention time shifts. In this article, we explore common problems with baseline variation, chromatographic peaks, and system pressure and offer practical tactics for resolving them. Use these general guidelines in combination with equipment manuals and your laboratory’s standard operating procedures to get your instrument back into service quickly and effectively.\nReestablishing a Smooth Baseline #  \rFigure 1: Abnormal baselines that are commonly encountered in LC troubleshooting\r\r\rEncountering an inconsistent baseline is not unusual in LC laboratories. Variation can be caused by a number of factors, and determining if there is a pattern can help you establish the cause (Figure 1). If you are seeing an erratic baseline, it is likely caused by a leak or an air bubble, so checking all fittings, confirming the degasser is working, and purging your system with fresh mobile phase should stabilize the baseline. If you are using a UV detector, a noisy baseline can also indicate that it is time to change the detector lamp or flow cell. However, if there is regularity to the changes in the baseline, it may be a pump or piston issue, and routine maintenance of those parts should resolve the problem. Finally, if the baseline is looking bad overall, a thorough system cleaning is recommended. Note that ambient temperature changes can also cause baseline fluctuations, so using a column oven or insulating the column and tubing may also restore performance.\rTroubleshooting Peak Issues #  Troubleshooting peak problems is necessary during both routine analysis and method development, but the changes that are allowable under those two scenarios are different. Issues with poor peak shape, sensitivity, and retention that develop over time in an established method that is otherwise performing well indicate a change has occurred (e.g., system leak, mobile phase deterioration, guard contamination, etc.) and resolving it through maintenance should restore performance. However, some of the tips discussed below, such as adding buffer to mobile phases or changing the column temperature, should not be made during routine analysis because they may require additional validation before implementation.\nIn contrast, peak issues seen during method development indicate further changes to method parameters may be needed, and more opportunities for improvement are available than when they are encountered with an established method. During method development, in addition to using the LC troubleshooting guidelines below, the sample preparation method, column stationary phase, and analytical conditions can be optimized for the matrices and compounds to be analyzed. When making changes to improve chromatographic peaks, it is important to first understand what factors can or cannot be changed based on your laboratory’s standard operating procedures.\nImproving Poor Peak Shape #  Sharp, symmetrical peaks improve accuracy and sensitivity, but many factors can cause peaks to tail, front, split, or broaden. These types of peak distortions often lead to other problems, such as shifting retention times or coelution. If you observe distorted peak shapes either during routine analysis or method development, the LC troubleshooting tips in Table I will help you diagnose the problem based on the symptoms you observe in the chromatogram.\nTable I: LC troubleshooting tips for improving peak shape.\n Untitled\nDealing With a Decrease in Sensitivity #  A loss in sensitivity can indicate problems with either the sample preparation or the analytical system.\nFirst, confirm that the sample preparation procedure was followed correctly, including storage temperature and time, and verify that system parameters are set correctly and functioning properly. Always check for obvious problems (e.g., calculation/dilution error, autosampler needle not reaching sample, incorrect injection volume, wrong detector settings, no mobile phase flow, detector or lamp turned off, integrity of the reference standard, etc.) before looking for more complex issues. Having a coworker double check your work can be invaluable because it is often easier for an independent person to spot problems than it is for someone who is already familiar with the work.\nOnce simple problems have been ruled out, analyzing a known standard is a helpful diagnostic tool for LC troubleshooting. If results are within the expected range, the system is performing well, and the problem is in the sample preparation or handling; however, if low response is also seen for the standard, the problem is likely with the instrument. It is also possible that analytes are simply outside of the instrument’s sensitivity range. In this case, sample concentration may bring them within range, but care must be taken to prevent the loss of more volatile analytes.\nIf poor response is seen only in the first few injections, it is possible that the sample is adsorbing to active sites in the sample loop or column. Using a passivation solution or making a few preliminary sample injections to condition the system and reduce adsorption prior to actual sample analysis may help restore analyte response. If response has decreased across all peaks, this is likely caused by calculation errors, incorrect dilutions, or a decrease in injection volume that may result from leaks, system malfunctions, programming errors, or use of the wrong size sample loop. If a catastrophic loss of retention is observed, it is possible that phase dewetting has occurred and the column must be regenerated or replaced, but this is a relatively rare event compared to other causes.\nFor LC-MS analysis, there could be additional causes responsible for a decrease in sensitivity. Issues with the MS analyzer can be a common source, so verifying that the MS performance is at its best is essential. Directly infusing the tuning solution into the MS (bypassing the LC system) is an easy step that provides useful information for troubleshooting. Since there are several possible causes of loss in MS sensitivity (e.g. cleanliness of the optics, buffer precipitate in the MS entrance, need to change an electron multiplier, ionization source performance, compounds tuning, etc.) we recommend checking with your manufacturer for specific troubleshooting information. Ion suppression due to matrix interferences can also cause poor response in LC-MS systems, but this typically must be addressed with major method changes that may require revalidation, such as better sample preparation procedures, use of internal or matrix-matched standards, and changes to the mobile phase composition.\nStabilizing Shifting Retention Times #  For accurate identification and quantification, it is critical that analytes always elute at the same retention time. However, it is not uncommon to observe retention time shifts during routine analysis, and there are a number of possible causes. As a first step in LC troubleshooting, verify that all method settings are correct and that the mobile phase was properly prepared (particularly if you see a big change instead of a slight drift). Preparing fresh mobile phase is an easy way to eliminate problems caused by composition changes due to evaporation, reactions, contamination, or incomplete mixing. Also, if you are transferring an existing method to a new instrument, be sure to account for any difference in `dwell volume` between the instruments because that can significantly affect retention time. Other possible causes include the following:\r Incorrect or variable flow rate—manually confirm that the flow rate is correct and verify that there are no leaks in the system. Temperature fluctuations—always use a thermostatically controlled column compartment. Solvent mismatch—make sure that the sample solvent is compatible with the starting mobile phase (try to match both the aqueous:organic ratio and the buffer strength). Sample overloading—don’t inject more sample than the column can hold. Column contamination/clogging—flush the column to remove any particulates, particularly if back pressure is also elevated. If this does not work, it may be time to replace the column. Using a guard column is recommended to minimize contamination and maximize column lifetime. Matrix interferences—analyze a solvent standard and compare it to your sample to see if the shifting peaks are actually matrix components. Insufficient column equilibration—allow more time between runs, sufficient time for passing 10 column volumes is recommended. Note: Column equilibration may take longer for HILIC analyses. Air bubbles—purge air from pump and ensure the mobile phase is degassed. Inspect pump seals and change if leaks are evident.  Occasionally, ghost peaks will appear at unexpected times during analysis. This can be tested by making a solvent injection after a sample injection. If a peak appears, it is likely a late-eluting peak carried over from the previous sample injection. In this situation, increasing the flow rate, extending the run time, or adding a gradient step may help eliminate the carryover problem. The risk of carryover can also be reduced by minimizing extra system volume by plumbing the LC with shorter, smaller diameter tubing and zero-dead-volume connections because this will reduce the places that sample can build up. In addition, needle wash solvents and needle wash parameters are important to consider in order to reduce carryover. Ghost peaks can also be caused by contamination in the mobile phase, guard column, or analytical column. This can be resolved by preparing fresh, degassed mobile phase; replacing the guard column; and replacing your analytical column (but first try flushing it according to the manufacturer’s recommended cleaning procedures).\nRestoring Normal System Pressure #  Diagnosing the Cause of Increased Back Pressure\nIncreased back pressure is one of the most common of all LC troubleshooting issues, but it is important to remember that not all pressure changes indicate a problem. For example, pressure will change during gradient analysis as mobile phase viscosity increases (maximum viscosities are at ~50:50 for methanol:water and ~20:80 for acetonitrile:water). So, it is important to know what is normal for your setup in order to diagnose a problem. It is also important to work within the pressure limits of your LC (e.g., do not use \u0026lt;2.7 µm columns in instruments with a 400 bar limit). When abnormally high back pressure is observed, it indicates a blockage exists somewhere in the system, and the first step in resolving it is to identify the location by isolating one potential source at a time following the steps in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: LC troubleshooting steps for locating system blockages that cause increased back pressure\rRemoving Column Clogs and Contaminants #  Increased back pressure and decreased chromatographic performance can indicate column contamination or blockage. Flushing the column and preventing future blockage using the following guidelines can solve the problem and extend the life of your analytical column.\nTreatment #  Flushing HPLC and UHPLC columns in the direction shown on the column with a series of solvents can be an effective way to remove both chemical contaminants and particulates that have formed clogs. Use a minimum of 20 column volumes of each solvent and flush in the order shown in Table II below. Following regeneration, always store your column in the solvent recommended by the column manufacturer.\nTable II: Solvent Sequence for Column Flushing\nPrevention #   Always use fresh, filtered mobile phases to remove particulates and prevent bacterial growth. Keep your mobile phase bottles capped to avoid contamination. If using MS analyzers, make sure you use LC-MS grade solvents and additives. Filter samples to remove matrix particulates; syringe filters and filter vials simplify this task. Confirm the sample solvent and mobile phases are compatible. Solvent mismatch can cause sample components or buffer salts to precipitate and form clogs. Use a guard column or precolumn filter to protect your analytical column. Always select a guard system and phase that matches the analytical column. Regularly inspect and replace pump seals, auto-injector rotors, inline filters, and needle seats before normal wear and tear causes them to break down and shed particles into the flow stream.  Although less common, it is also possible to encounter pressures that are too low. In this scenario, leaks are a usually the culprit, so check your fittings and pump carefully for signs of moisture or precipitates. If tightening or replacing the fittings does not solve the problem, it may be time to replace the pump seals. Trapped air bubbles or a stuck check valve can also cause pressure drops, but both issues can generally be fixed by flushing the system with degassed mobile phase or an appropriate solvent, such as isopropyl alcohol. If this does not resolve this problem, it may be time to replace the check valves. Some leaks could be due to scratches in the rotor seal in six-port valves. The leak may not be visible, but it will cause a drop in the pressure and flow. When looking for leaks or measuring flow rate accuracy, be sure to utilize an old column or a flow restrictor. In addition to pressure drops, leaks can cause other chromatographic problems, such as increased retention, decreased signal, or even automatic instrument shut down. To prevent this, make it a daily practice to inspect fittings for residue, and wipe tubing with a lab tissue to detect moisture. Gently retightening fittings and regularly replacing tubing, fittings, and seals as part of your routine maintenance plan is a good way to prevent catastrophic leaks and unexpected downtime. Restek’s Routine LC Maintenance guide is a helpful starting place when developing or refining a maintenance plan.\nReference #   Effective LC Troubleshooting: Symptom-Based Strategies and Solutions\nSummary #  LC troubleshooting is an essential part of generating accurate and reliable data. While there are many potential causes of poor performance, careful observation of the chromatographic symptoms, testing of one possible cause at a time, and comparison to an established “normal” state will help you quickly and effectively identify the root cause. Finally, working any lessons learned into a routine maintenance plan will help prevent future problems and keep your instrument running more efficiently.\n.row {\rmargin-left:-5px;\rmargin-right:-5px;\r}\r.row::after {\rcontent: \"\";\rclear: both;\rdisplay: table;\r}\rfigure {\rtext-align: left;\rfont-style: italic;\rfont-size: smaller;\rtext-indent: 0;\rmargin: 0.5em;\rpadding: 0.5em;\r}\r "},{"id":166,"href":"/docs/07-Troubleshooting/Part-02-Sciex-LC-MSMS/Sciex_01/","title":"Sciex System Issues","section":"Part II Sciex LC-MS/MS Troubleshooting Guide","content":"Figure : \rFigure : Sciex System Issues\r"},{"id":167,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-01-Theory/Tem/","title":"Tem","section":"Part I Theory","content":"Figure : \r"},{"id":168,"href":"/docs/03-Mass-Spec-GC-MS/Part-2-Application/Agilent_GC_and_GC-MS_Scientists_Answer_Your_Most_FAQ/","title":"Agilent GC and GC-MS Scientists Answer Your Most FAQ","section":"Part II","content":"Agilent GC and GC-MS Scientists Answer Your Most FAQ\nAsk the Agilent experts Part Two GC and GCMS scientists answer your most frequently asked questions.

And welcome to the second edition of Ask the Experts. The first question we have in this session is what happens if there\u0026rsquo;s a leak in my gas lines? And can I ask Andy to answer that question, please? Absolutely. And that is a great question. So I think we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed a bit before about leaks causing an increase in column bleed. But this won\u0026rsquo;t be the only chromatographic symptom that you\u0026rsquo;re going to see. With respect to oxygen in your column, your peak sheets going to start to suffer. And to demonstrate this, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at a common analyte used in some texts, test mixes to ethyl hexanoic acid and how its symmetry is affected with the increase in both temperature and oxygen. So in this experiment, a wax column was held at a final temperature for 12 hours with a controlled amount of oxygen in the carrier gas so we could get a really detailed understanding of how the amount of gas and temperature affects that peak shape. So you can see that the peak shape for the two ethyl hexanoic acid at 250 degrees for 12 hours looks pretty great. But as we increase the final temperature and add 10 parts per million of oxygen to the tear gas or symmetry starts to degrade and we see more peak tailing. And that\u0026rsquo;s happening because your face is getting irreparably damaged. That causes a peak tailing, and at which point, you may need to clip off a part of the front end column, or worst case scenario, replace that entire column. And both of which are going to cause increased downtime and loss of your productivity. So a great way to keep leaks out of your GC is using those self tightening nuts because you don\u0026rsquo;t have to remember to re tighten the nut after thermal cycles. They have that spring driven piston design that adjust to the natural expansion and contraction that happens during your multiple GC of insect goals. And you don\u0026rsquo;t need tools to use them, it\u0026rsquo;s just hand tightened. And of course, we have one for your GC inlet and detectors and the mass spec transfer line, as well. And both use the same polyamid graphite Farrells. So you can have one Farrell to roll your whole GC makes life very, very nice and easy. And they\u0026rsquo;re one of the easiest ways to prevent oxygen from getting into the GC flowpath. So there\u0026rsquo;s a few other problems that can be caused with a leak, you can get elevated background, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about this before we get reduced peak response and of course, our aforementioned peak tailing a specific for GCMs. You may shorten your filament and electron multiple layer lifetimes and that is causing increased sores, and mass spec mint maintenance. But, you know, how do we lead check every part of our GCMs both inside and out, you can use a leak detector, and especially our new Agilent cross lab, cartridge system leak detector. And it works really well at spotting leaks even down to three microliters per minute for gases like helium or hydrogen. Going to take just a little more time to talk about this new leak detector. It\u0026rsquo;s designed on that same handheld unit as the ATM flow meter. So it\u0026rsquo;s one bass can be used for both cartridges, whether it\u0026rsquo;s the leak detector or flow meter, no, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we tend to use the same thing at the same time. So one base to do both the work. This leak detector can also detect nitrogen leaks. So that\u0026rsquo;s nice. It\u0026rsquo;s not quite as sensitive as it is to hydrogen and helium because we\u0026rsquo;re referencing to the thermal conductivity of ambient air. But you can still find your nitrogen or oxygen leaks. And the table just shown on the bottom right here gives you a couple examples of the minimum detectable leak rates for a handful of gases. And these aren\u0026rsquo;t just your GCS, remember, you got an ICP our guns, not the cheapest gas in the world. So that would be a good one to use a leak detector on. But let\u0026rsquo;s talk about where we should use the leak detector in the lab and around our instruments. Let\u0026rsquo;s start at the gas source. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it\u0026rsquo;s a cylinder or a tower connection. Because your whole building has helium or hydrogen plumbed to it, you need to check those connection points they can and absolutely will leak. And remember your regulator, if you have an old regulator, it\u0026rsquo;s going to age over time it wears, it can cause leaks. Next, following the gas line, we go to our filter connections and our gas clean filter system. Be sure to let me check this wage like fittings and the ring both the top and the bottom of the ring of that system to make sure it is fully leak tight. And of course, if you have more than one gas filter, do them all. If we flip around, or GCMs in this case, and look at the back, we need to check every single one of those fittings behind the GC, except for the ones that are instrument air going to your fid. We can\u0026rsquo;t really like detect on those ones. And I know everyone asks, Do I really have to check every single T every single connection? Absolutely. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of parts that you could have leaks come up from. And let\u0026rsquo;s reduce your problems with your EPCs and call them and also do not use snoop. Snoop can be really bad for those electronic pressure control modules and your flow path if it gets into the gas line. So please don\u0026rsquo;t use Snoop use a leak detector right now. So he said we could check on the outside we can also check on the inside of the GC. We need to make sure to check the septum not in turn top. Those septum nuts were out over time and leak. I\u0026rsquo;ve had it happen to myself so I know it\u0026rsquo;s true. And sometimes our turn types just aren\u0026rsquo;t tight enough. So check it with the leak detector. Once we look in the oven, check your inlet and detector connections even if you self tightening nuts just the first time you put them in. Check it and make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got good connection. Moving along to the column. If you use capillary flow technology or CFT, check those connections. No matter if it\u0026rsquo;s a purge, or on purge device, we don\u0026rsquo;t want any leaks coming in and destroying our columns and our analyses. And then last but not least, is our mass spec transfer line. Again, even if we\u0026rsquo;re using self tightening that it\u0026rsquo;s just always a good habit to double check that leak fitting, or that fitting for leaks. The only problem is leak detector isn\u0026rsquo;t going to help us too much on the mass spec. So specifically focusing on that part of the detector, we need to check our vent valve, the transfer line, which we talked about, and then also the analyzer side door. So one way to leak check your mass spec is with a bitterest free electronics duster, because you can do some live manual tune profiling of the ions to find your leaks. And we like to do that because it\u0026rsquo;s a really quick way to sniff them out. Now, if you aren\u0026rsquo;t sure what mass is to look for, you can enter the cast number into the NIS library or search for this vector online to help ID, your mastercharge ratios. And so we just wanted to show you a quick way of how to do this in manual tune. In my case, the electronics Duster has mastercharge ratios of 69 and 83. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to navigate to the manual tune from the instrument drop down menu when we\u0026rsquo;re in our normal mass center acquisition, and then you click Edit tune parameters. And then on the top right, there\u0026rsquo;s a profile tab, click on Profile, and we\u0026rsquo;ll do some live tuning. Enter your mass to charge ratio values, set your window I like point five because it gives me a nice tight window. And then you spray three short bursts of electronic duster at each spot. Wait about 15 to 30 seconds between each because it will light up really fast. If you have a leak. You\u0026rsquo;ll do it at the vent about your transfer line your side door. And then make sure you check the entire length from the side door because leaks don\u0026rsquo;t just happen at one spot. Had it happen in the back. It\u0026rsquo;s a really pain in the neck when you miss that one. So it\u0026rsquo;s one way to do it. The other way is if you don\u0026rsquo;t have electronics duster, or ran out, you can instead run an air water check. Great and easy way to do it. You can navigate to tune in vacuum control. And then there\u0026rsquo;s a tune menu, you\u0026rsquo;ll find air and water check. Click that. And you can run it or tune evaluation if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the electronic stressors. But remember, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to to check for leaks. But let\u0026rsquo;s make sure we are leak free so we don\u0026rsquo;t destroy our consumables. Wonderful Many thanks, Andy out Vanessa, do you have anything to add to that face? I would say if you suspect that you have a leak. First and foremost, don\u0026rsquo;t panic. And don\u0026rsquo;t take your oven up to a high temperature, because that\u0026rsquo;s when you could start damaging some phase. So first, start with the usual suspects. So a lot of times if you think about what might have just been done, did you just replace a septum or replace the liner start there. And also kind of work your way from the easiest things to fix and then go down through the GC. One thing I like to do with the electronic duster, if I\u0026rsquo;m going to be doing that magnet manual tune, I actually will, I\u0026rsquo;ll work backwards. So I\u0026rsquo;ll spray the analyzer door first, then I would spray the transfer line and then kind of move through because what will happen is if you say spray the inlet first with your adjuster, and then you try and go back to really quickly Wait 30 seconds and then say spray or transfer line well, and then maybe you see a peak right away? Well, it might not necessarily mean that it was either the the transfer line because your gases have to move through your column. There is that hold of time that every column has that that\u0026rsquo;s the amount of time that compounds stay in, move their way through the column without interacting with the column phase. And that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s happening if you were say, to spray the inlet first. And so you\u0026rsquo;ve got to give it maybe if I sprayed the inlet first, I usually give it about two to three minutes depending on the column. Obviously, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to be using a 60 meter column, maybe give it three to four minutes to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on. And then to try and just but that\u0026rsquo;s also why when I\u0026rsquo;m using dust off, or electronic duster thing, I go from the door first because if you\u0026rsquo;ve had that door open to say clean your source or whatnot, that O ring can sometimes get a little bit bendy and so you want to before you close it up. You want to make sure that that\u0026rsquo;s all nice and tight. And that\u0026rsquo;s where as Andy said, sometimes you could have a leak coming from the back of the analyzer door. So that\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s, you know, just kind of work your way through. And I know Andy was talking about the new leak detector. Actually, before we even had that, I was using the flow meter, that kind of that part that goes with it to try and identify some leaks a long time ago. So I\u0026rsquo;d had this one weird situation with headspace system, or all of a sudden our flows are just really off, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out where it was going. And because all of our leaks were tight on the GC itself. But as we were checking our split line, and our split that line checking those flows, we realized that there was something happening from that connection from the headspace. And so actually, that helped me diagnose, there was one small connection of just two copper pipes that are two of the of my lines, gas lines, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a connector that wasn\u0026rsquo;t tight enough. So if I had had the the leak detector, at that point, it would have been a lot easier. But at least even using that flow meter was another great tool that I could at least help to diagnose where that leak was. And also, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking at your air and water check, and you see a higher level of nitrogen versus oxygen, that is usually telling me that my leak is probably coming from inside the GC, whereas if your leak is on the outside, you\u0026rsquo;ll have more oxygen in it. So kind of just look at those values to kind of figure out where that leak might be. And just yeah, don\u0026rsquo;t panic. It\u0026rsquo;ll be okay. Just don\u0026rsquo;t take it up to temperature, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine. Fantastic advice many things, Vanessa, of course, yeah, the key thing for me is that if you don\u0026rsquo;t go and use a leak detector for leaks coming out of the system, and like spray gas, for leaks going into the system, and you just go right and just going to tighten everything, then what you could do is go and fix one leak and create leaks elsewhere. Because, of course, over tightening fittings will also create leaks. And when you have a fitting as overtightened new, the only thing you can do is go and replace that Farrell or replace that fitting to go and really fix it. So don\u0026rsquo;t jump in. Don\u0026rsquo;t try and tighten everything up. Really identify the source of the leak before you do anything further, which I think you both agree on. Yeah, and slowly tighten things, especially self tightening column nuts, don\u0026rsquo;t take any tools to it. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people start transfer lines this way. So just go just a little bit. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s a standard. Nut like just go very small, very baby steps. You can always go more, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot harder to go back and replace transfer line. Absolutely, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the bottom of inlets as well bent at bottom. And better than the ends of trans people have really like got their shoulder behind it. tightening it, especially with gratifies Farrell. Farrell is just like really getting into it and stuff. And it\u0026rsquo;s just like no, no, not gonna cost you change about some money to replace is not good. squeaking is bad. I always do the one finger test. If I can move it with one finger, it\u0026rsquo;s least if you can\u0026rsquo;t move it with one finger, then essentially, then it\u0026rsquo;s probably going to be tight enough. So yeah, yeah, one thing just There we go. Brilliant. Thank you very much. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s just fascinating either. Yeah, in some ways, leaks are horrible, but I love diagnosing them and tracking them down and determining where they are. And it\u0026rsquo;s just like, and again, yeah, one of the things of course, is if your cylinder is outside, and that first cold snap when in the ultimate becomes winter. And of course over the summer or your fittings have expanded and then suddenly, they\u0026rsquo;re now contracting and suddenly, your your cylinder disc depletes of all the gas because it\u0026rsquo;s something that first. So again, that\u0026rsquo;s a little bit of advice, as well as if you\u0026rsquo;ve got anything outside or anything where temperature changes massively, then that\u0026rsquo;s also really key to go look at. But brilliant. Thank you very much. Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna move on to our second question, which is why do I need gas filters? And can I ask Vanessa to address that first, please? Of course, and Angie, if you could move one more. So guess call filters you need them. I don\u0026rsquo;t care how clean you think your gas lines are. You want to have those gas filters connected to your system. So there\u0026rsquo;s two parts with the gas filter that we got to talk about. There\u0026rsquo;s the oxygen and the moisture. So these are two different things that will affect your column and your GC differently. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at just with oxygen itself. So with this one we were using a four nines helium to test this out so not our normal five nines and with this, you see with the the black line that is with no filter and then we have Looking at that same, same four nines with a filter. So this is what we see is actually a five times drop in the background once we\u0026rsquo;ve added this gas filter. So this is really important for protecting our system from oxygen. And if you can move one more place. And so water is also the other big issue. So we want to make sure you know, depending on whatever your environment is, in the summertime, it might be more humid where you are, or you might have had some crazy rainstorms, and who knows what\u0026rsquo;s going on and the humidity in your building. So with that, we want to make sure that we have that moisture trapped on our gasoline filter to protect our system. With this, you can see that that gasoline filter lowered that water signal by a factor of 10. And with this, it will actually you know, help to explore apps who think expand our lifetime, much longer for our column in our chromatography. So these are just the first parts that we want to look at with just the gasoline filter. And now if you can move to the next slide, there\u0026rsquo;s something I always want to remind people of is that there is also in addition to a gasoline filter, we call this the big universal trap. So the big universal trap is a great thing to have installed as well into your system to help also protect the lifetime, not only of your gas filter, but also your GC. And it\u0026rsquo;s important to also mount it vertically for it to actually function properly. So this it works together. And also one thing I like to do with this big universal trap is I write the date that I install it on there, because a lot of times this might be behind a wall or underneath the desk. So you want to make sure that you know the last time you replaced it. Because if for some reason you start seeing your guests and filter, maybe get spent more recently or more frequently, that\u0026rsquo;s when it could be you need to remember to change your big universal track out as well. So both are very important. And now we can move to the next slide, please. So here\u0026rsquo;s another example. So using low purity gas, that can contain oxygen and other contaminants. And if you don\u0026rsquo;t already know how bad oxygen is for your column, you have an experiment that can show just how bad the chromatogram on top shows ultra high purity helium gas and from injection one to injection 20 shown in blue. So with here we have no change in retention time or sensitivity. Now in the bottom chromatogram we adopt our helium carrier gas with approximately 5% Oxygen. And you can see the difference between injection one and injection 20 in blue, you can see the dramatic decrease in response and retention time shift from that first peak. And if we look at the elevated baseline in the background at that higher temperatures, that\u0026rsquo;s the oxygen inflicting permanent irreversible damage on your column, which then results in a lot of other chromatographic issues. So it ultimately means that there\u0026rsquo;s going to be more money spent on filaments, liners columns, and pretty much means that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be doing way more maintenance, like cleaning your source more frequently. So the first cure for this potential problem is using ultra high purity carry your gas. So it\u0026rsquo;s essential for GCMs that you want to use five, nine, so 99.9995% or greater. So the second tip would be also using these are our carrier gas filters. So adjuvants, gas, clean GCMs filters can be used with any mass spec, as well as any GC doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be with a mass spec. And one awesome thing about these gas filters is that they\u0026rsquo;re clear so you can see when the indicator starts to go bad. And it also makes it easier for those to monitor those indicators more closely, incorrect leaks when you start to see them happen, and start to replace what you need to write up right away. So we do recommend changing these annually to avoid any kind of potential damage. But also it could be more frequently depending on what you see. When the look at the indicator on the gasoline filter starts to change, you can also tell if your leak might be upstream or downstream. So if the color changes from the top down, that could indicate a problem with your gas supply. So maybe your cylinder has a connection that might have a leak. Or for some reason, instead of getting the ultra pure gas that you thought was going to be delivered. It could have been you know, maybe four nines instead. And then if the indicator changes from bottom to the top that could actually indicate more of a leak going on in your GCMs. So this could help you to figure out how to correct the problem and then keep your system running properly. And if you could move on to the Next. So there is also another one that I like to talk about. And this is kind of the difference between using gas cylinders and gas generators. So first, both of these, you do still want to use your gasoline filters, we do recommend them. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk about a little bit of the pros and cons. So with gas cylinders, you are in charge of the pressure delivery that you need, you adjust your regulator as need be, you can have them in a wide variety of different gases. So you can have helium, nitrogen, if you\u0026rsquo;re doing CI, you have your methane. So and then also size, depending on your gas cabinet, or whatever gas setup you have, you can change that. And pretty much the only maintenance, once you have your gas lines nice and tight, you would just need to replace them when it\u0026rsquo;s empty. But the downside is you might have to be reliant on the gas company for their availability or potential for delivery, which can change depending on what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I know I\u0026rsquo;ve talked to some people where the gas company has the available gases, but they might not have the people who can deliver them at a certain time. So that is really, you know, up to you. Now with gas generators, you\u0026rsquo;re not reliant on a gas company, but they do need routine maintenance. I know with I have a hydrogen, I have an air compressor, zero air and nitrogen generator in my lab. And they do all require a little bit different maintenance. And right now I\u0026rsquo;m going to be probably replacing a membrane on my air compressor. So it\u0026rsquo;s like you have to pay attention to what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Same thing for hydrogen generators, you have to make sure that those are routinely maintained, because I have heard of not in my lab, but in other labs, you could have potentially water get through a membrane. So this is also why if you are using a Hydrogen Generator, I also recommend using a moisture trap in line after that. Now will that save you have all this on the membrane goes? No, but it is a potential a little protection, and it should be very good. I have not had any issues with my nitrogen system. So I will just say that. But I do also make sure that I routinely I maintain them, I see what\u0026rsquo;s going on. If I try and preempt I trying to see what might be happening with delivery. There is also a max delivery capacity of various generators. So depending on how many systems you have, you may need to have more than one helium or sorry, one more than one Hydrogen Generator or more than one nitrogen generator, depending on what you\u0026rsquo;re working on. I know for myself I was trying to get I maxed out my nitrogen output because I had way more I forgot that I didn\u0026rsquo;t always have all of these F IDs on and all my ECG is on at the same time. And then I was wondering why it was the thing is shutting down on me. And that\u0026rsquo;s because I exceeded that limit. And I needed to factor in what I\u0026rsquo;m working on. So that you do have to think about that delivery capacity of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. There can be an initial cost as you\u0026rsquo;re having to buy the generator, and also making sure that you have the right amount of power circuits around because we don\u0026rsquo;t want to overload circuits, you always want to make sure that everything\u0026rsquo;s nice and balanced. And the one downside is there is no helium gas generators. So you do still need if you\u0026rsquo;re going to be using helium as your carrier gas, you do still need to purchase cylinders. But you know what, they\u0026rsquo;re both great options. It really just depends what works best for your lab. And like we said before, they both need that gasoline filter, because let\u0026rsquo;s just protect ourselves. It\u0026rsquo;s like a nice little security blanket like it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be right there, see what\u0026rsquo;s going on. And you can see if there\u0026rsquo;s any extra moisture oxygen in the line. And if there\u0026rsquo;s any maintenance you need to do, you can take care of that. Wonderful. Thanks, Vanessa. And I totally agree. You know, in some situations you like, Oh, I really need cylinders, and sometimes actually no gas generated is by far the best option. So again, I totally agree. Andy, do you have anything to add to that, please? I think Vanessa did a great review on gas filters and just built on our kind of elite discussion that keep our systems really great and clean. I know, in my experience, we have a lot of whole building generations so we don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about it in some cases at the bottom. But even though we\u0026rsquo;re using towers in our labs and just pulling off the main source, there was a point where they\u0026rsquo;re using the flexible metal. It was like stainless steel braided connections for some of the big connections from outside to inside. And they actually went through in didn\u0026rsquo;t leak checking on it because our guests filters were going faster than we expected these normally They last a pretty good long time and at least a year and we\u0026rsquo;re looking at them and say how in like six months or that one went in like a month, what is going on, they went back and leech checked, and actually were able to decrease how much helium we ordered, because they clean up all those braided lines. So that is one nice part of the gas filter is if there\u0026rsquo;s a spot coming in with leaks, or, you know, as Vanessa said, a bad batch of gas, and whether that\u0026rsquo;s, you know, nitrogen or hydrogen or helium, those will catch it and help you diagnose it, find it, fix it, and then, you know, kind of save you any headaches of why don\u0026rsquo;t I have the sensitivity I used? Absolutely. And how about the hydrocarbons as well, I mean, how important is it to have, you know, remove those hydrocarbons as well. Especially if you have like instrument air, and I know, we\u0026rsquo;ve got like a big compressor, and someone did a unofficial anecdotal study on their FIDM, where they didn\u0026rsquo;t have filters on it. And they can watch the background like, kind of oscillate with when the, the the pump was like turning on because the hydrocarbons would pump up or just like, Yeah, put a filter on now one place. Absolutely. And of course, you know, and the thing with cylinders, of course, is making sure that you don\u0026rsquo;t ever completely empty your cylinder. Because of course, you know, when you\u0026rsquo;ve got pressure in there, I mean, a cylinder, even with high purity, it never has zero impurities in there. Of course, you know whether when you\u0026rsquo;ve got pressure in there, it keeps all the impurities pushed the walls of that cylinder. And of course, when you empty the cylinder, they all come out and start coming into the system. So I always say kind of like about when that when I\u0026rsquo;m a scuba diver. And once when I run out of air, and honestly, the last bit of air that you\u0026rsquo;re breathing, it tastes like putting your mouth right next to an old car exhaust, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty GCMs it\u0026rsquo;s, you would never ever completely empty your cylinder ever again, I think. But of course, again, protective measures of having a gasoline filter is really important. So hopefully, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to have leaks, hopefully you\u0026rsquo;re not gonna have problems, like I just mentioned, they\u0026rsquo;re there for protection and very useful for that. Right. And don\u0026rsquo;t try some of these experiments yourself. We will do them for you trust us. We will just write this for you and tell you what happened. Absolutely. I was just looking at some of your chromatograms just now going I\u0026rsquo;m glad that\u0026rsquo;s not my column. Brilliant. Thank you so much. Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to move on to question three then. So should you use helium or hydrogen as a carrier gas when you\u0026rsquo;re doing your analysis using GCMs? So I think Angie is going to answer that, please. Absolutely. And this is our favorite answer. It\u0026rsquo;s It depends. So I think Vanessa, and I joke we should just call a webinar series, it depends. And because that seems to be always our answer. The first off, why would you even want to use hydrogen. Because if you look at your van Deeter curves, you can see that hydrogen can has more optimal velocity at a higher velocity. So you can potentially have a faster analysis. There\u0026rsquo;s also the potential for lower temperature separations, moving to your more efficient columns. So I think 30 meter, point two 5.25. As we shortcut, the statement of it is really popular in most helium cases moving to hydrogen, you pretty well should move to a 20 meter, point one eight, because of the difference in your gas pressures, you could have a negative psi technically, for hydrogen with that 30 meter column. And so that\u0026rsquo;s just so you can move to that more efficient column and kind of slide through and do that faster analysis. Hydrogen can be available on demand with a Hydrogen Generator. So you know, kind of frees you up from that helium supply pressure that seems to come and go every few years. And a lot of cases if you have other detectors other than a mass spec in your lab, you\u0026rsquo;re already using it for fid and some of your other detectors so you may already have around it, maybe not. I think I want to do hydrogen for a carrier gas. And just a reminder that you know, hydrogen is safe. It\u0026rsquo;s not scary. We\u0026rsquo;re not dealing with the Hindenburg anymore. We have you know, shut offs on the system to make sure that systems protected and keeps everyone safe. So you there really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too much fear and especially Since smoking I don\u0026rsquo;t think is allowed in labs anymore, for extra better on that one. But it\u0026rsquo;s always good to have a healthy respect for any gases you\u0026rsquo;re working with. So just hydrogen safe, you can use it just don\u0026rsquo;t be, you know, careless with it, of course. You know, but it also it\u0026rsquo;s extremely diffused, so it\u0026rsquo;s gonna kind of go out really quickly. So we have to think about a few things as we talk about a transition from helium to hydrogen, especially as a carrier gas. So your gas line is going to be changed. Really, we suggest using stainless steel lines when you\u0026rsquo;re working with hydrogen, because if you have that old copper line that\u0026rsquo;s been on there for 1015 50 years, it\u0026rsquo;s going to get all types of pitted and fun, things are going to come out of your copper with hydrogen. So please, switch to stainless steel, use a gasoline filter, You especially want to add a large moisture trap. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing a Hydrogen Generator, like it was necessary just to protect yourself, give yourself some caution. And we really want to scrub out any of our impurities. So big universal trap followed by our gasoline filter helps you identify when your different parts need to be replaced. To do so what else we need to do. Of course, we already talked about a faster analysis, you really need to decrease your flow for your mass spec source. Because we need to get optimum ionization. You know, when you\u0026rsquo;re using helium as a carrier gas, our optimum flow rate is around one, one and a half mils per minute, best is going to point eight to 1.2, especially for the high efficiency source. So you need to kind of drop that down a little bit, when using hydrogen, you can still hold close to that point eight, one, don\u0026rsquo;t go too much lower. And definitely don\u0026rsquo;t go too fast. Because you can dilute the ions in your source and decrease your sensitivity. We also know that hydrogen has the risk of decency, decreasing your sensitivity already, just with the nature of hydrogen, and the mass spec source. don\u0026rsquo;t always see eye to eye depending on your compounds. But we\u0026rsquo;ll talk a little bit about that on the next slide. See what else we talked about. And we also need to make sure those vacuum pumps aren\u0026rsquo;t having to work really, really hard. You also need to consider that your mass discharge ratios and your eye on ratios may look a little different. Again, this is coming into the factor of think about what is in your mass spec. You know that is a big metal source, using stainless steel, stainless steel and hydrogen love to create catalytic reactions. And I\u0026rsquo;ll see some other inert sources may as well do you really need to be careful when searching its programs against NIST. Because those were collected with helium as your carrier, yes, you need to watch those iron ratios, and probably do a one to one comparison of what it looked like with helium versus hydrogen, you have no change. That\u0026rsquo;s okay, you know, you\u0026rsquo;re good. If you have major changes, you might need to think about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. And of course, when you\u0026rsquo;re changing carrier gases, you absolutely need to change your tune file. helium and hydrogen are very different animals, you need a new tune file. Some things to avoid, avoid your chlorinated solvents dichloromethane, your sulfur solvents, carbon disulfide chemical reactions occurring with hydrogen in the inlet, you put some water, you put some hydrogen, you put the hot inlet together, and you\u0026rsquo;ll make some lovely hydrochloric acid. So let\u0026rsquo;s please avoid that, as best we can. And you kind of talked a little bit about with your metal in the stores hydrogen is not inert. Helium is lovely because it\u0026rsquo;s inert. The hydrogen can have those potential interactions happen, especially at elevated temperatures. So it\u0026rsquo;s going to keep a slightly cooler inlet, potentially a slightly cooler, mass spec source and quad as well. So hydrogen GCMs might work for you, but it may not be perfect for everyone. And we want to just give you an example why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily work for everyone. So here in the top less left, the figure is the mismas spectrum for nitrobenzene. And that\u0026rsquo;s in helium carrier gas or molecular ions when 23 mastercharge ratio and 93 mass to charge ratio is just a small component of the mass spectrum. What happens when we introduce hydrogen carrier gas instead with GCMs is we see a flip in the abundance of 93 and one 23 And that\u0026rsquo;s indicating that nitrobenzene has been converted to AnnaLynne. Basically hydrogenated our nitrobenzene in the source. And we know it\u0026rsquo;s happening in the source, because it\u0026rsquo;s alluding at the time of nitrobenzene, not AnnaLynne, which was earlier. And then this was confirmed in those extracted ion chromatograms, that are to the right 93 is a lot bigger than it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be. So we don\u0026rsquo;t want to see hydrogenation in the source with hydrogen carrier gas, because we want to detect and report what is actually in the sample. And that can get really confusing. If you have hydrogenation. Hopefully, I haven\u0026rsquo;t scared everyone off of using hydrogen it just needs means you need to take some time and think about what\u0026rsquo;s best for your system. You know, our recommendations are using a nine millimeter extraction lens, if you have an inert plus, or an extractor system, that\u0026rsquo;ll give you the best response based on all the experiments on myself and some other colleagues have done, lower that column flow rate compared to the helium flow rate, probably gonna have to do some retention time and method development. But that\u0026rsquo;s the fun part of our job, right? It\u0026rsquo;s always best to switch that more efficient column. Using if you use that standard 30 meter. Your pressure, as I said, at the control module will be about one psi, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit too low, or a lot a bit too low, you generally want your pressure on your control module to be at least 10 ballparks, you know, eight, fine 20 Fine one not fine. So it\u0026rsquo;s also like, is it better to switch that smaller column diameter and as best you can to get the similar theoretical plates if possible? No, it\u0026rsquo;s not always possible. But we we do our best. Always, always, always, always, always, always use gas filters. And especially with a Hydrogen Generator, make sure it\u0026rsquo;s producing hydrogen at least to 80 to 100% efficiency, we need really good efficient hydrogen production to keep up our carrier gas flow rates. And then you may want to allow your system some longer time to bake out, especially on initial setup. If you\u0026rsquo;ve always run helium systems may need to kind of settle in and clean out a little bit longer, because hydrogen is going in there and scrubbing around any type of dirt it might find. To avoid, there are some things we avoid, if you can, chlorinated solvents and hot inlets. As I said, you might create some hydrochloric acid and that doesn\u0026rsquo;t agree with columns, I believe that might at your column. So let\u0026rsquo;s not do that. It\u0026rsquo;s also better to avoid our heavily chlorinated compounds, because they can be chlorinate. So another form of hydrogenation, your PCBs. You know, some a lot of your pesticides are heavily chlorinated. They\u0026rsquo;re not going to be happy compounds around hydrogen, especially in the source, and then avoid your nitro compounds like nitrobenzene, again, likely to hydrogenate and replace those hydrogens rather quickly. So the question is, oh, what do we have left? What can we do? Honestly, the easiest ones to transfer to hydrogen carrier gas, or hydrocarbon analyses, or polycyclic, aromatic hydrocarbons. They they\u0026rsquo;re just happy as as can be around hydrogen. So those are options, you could most easily switch to hydrogen on your GCMs and then evaluate others from there. I\u0026rsquo;ll get off my hydrogen soapbox for a little while. Oh, brilliant, many thanks, Andy. Yes, lots to think about there, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? And I mean, it is so worth it, I think in the end, because you know, but you do have to put the effort in, you can\u0026rsquo;t just spend your costs and go Lalalalala, by that method will just run out in the hydrogen now and expect it all to work, you do have to do a little bit of work, etc. There. So, Vanessa, do you have anything to add? Please? I will say it because Angie covered a lot. The one thing that you can totally do is if you\u0026rsquo;re wondering how much time you might be able to save use it by switching to hydrogen, you can use our method translator to just verify so put your current parameters into, say the left side column, saying that you\u0026rsquo;re using helium, and then put in that you\u0026rsquo;re going to change the gas on the right column to hydrogen, you can check for if you\u0026rsquo;re going to change column dimensions. So seeing how much time you\u0026rsquo;ll be, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to say by going from the 30 meter standard to a 20 meter high efficiency column. You can also say you know, best efficiency, and it will give you already these inputs of here\u0026rsquo;s the values that you\u0026rsquo;re going to get and you can actually then just apply that to the new method. So once like we said it\u0026rsquo;s not for everything, and there will be some differences but if you\u0026rsquo;re watching To do that, that\u0026rsquo;s a way where you can see what that benefits going to get you. Because that\u0026rsquo;s a really great way just for speeding things up. If you are using for those hydrocarbons, or those pH is where, say if you, you need that extra time, if you\u0026rsquo;re doing a lot of high throughput analysis, that\u0026rsquo;s one thing where you can show your managers or whatnot, hey, here is our cost benefit analysis, we can run X number more samples in a day, with quality controls, maintaining ISO regulations, whatnot. And here\u0026rsquo;s maybe where we can start, say, if you want it to show that the benefit or why you want to get the Hydrogen Generator, here\u0026rsquo;s where it can benefit you. So excellent. I mean, it was actually one of my Agilent GCMs systems. So first of all, it\u0026rsquo;s all it\u0026rsquo;s all installed with stainless steel tubing, but we actually have hydrogen and helium is a carrier gas. And what I have then is I have the hydrogen comes in, the helium comes in a big filter for each and it goes to a gas selection valve. And I can then switch between helium or hydrogen. And of course, then go into my configuration and tell it it\u0026rsquo;s using hydrogen or helium, but it\u0026rsquo;s great for those applications you\u0026rsquo;re not sure about. So you can develop your methods using the right columns and everything but with helium, and then you can switch over purchase system through and then tweak your parameters and the hydrogen. And then you\u0026rsquo;ve got direct comparison on the same GCMs system for both helium and hydrogen. And that is just brilliant for data. Because it\u0026rsquo;s not even like say, Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a different system. Therefore, it will give me the slightly different results, you can do an exact comparison, which is brilliant. And you know, it just takes like five minutes to switch between the two. So I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;ve got any customers doing that. But I definitely recommend it for those all those ones, where you say you\u0026rsquo;re using the same instrument, but for different applications, and some are good for hydrogen and some are good, not so good. You have to use helium, but you want to reduce your helium consumption. So that is an option that I\u0026rsquo;ve had running for quite a few years, actually, on one of our systems, it works quite well. So brilliant. Thank you very much. Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to move on to Question four, which is how long should I condition my column? And I think Vanessa is going to be answering yes, then please. Yeah, yeah. So this is, like we said, you know, it all depends on what type of column that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be doing, using. So the time it takes and the temperature that you\u0026rsquo;re going to condition is going to vary depending on the phase of column that you\u0026rsquo;re using, as well as the maximum temperature you\u0026rsquo;re planning on operating at. So what I like to do is take my column up to that maximum temperature that I need to operate out without going above the maximum temperature stated on the box with the gas flow on and hold it there for about an hour. So again, this is going to vary depending on the type of column that you\u0026rsquo;re using and the maximum temperature. So I would say that a column is deemed condition when that baseline is flat, and no longer decreases, which is really easy to see if you\u0026rsquo;re looking at it on an fid. So this is a conditioning profile have a DD five H T column that I conditioned at 380 degrees for just over two hours. So this DB five H T column is on special high temperature temperature few silica. So I will just say it can be taken up to 400 degrees Celsius, but regular fused silica should not be taken above 350, because that\u0026rsquo;s the temperature limits of traditional polyamid FISA columns. So what you see is an initial jump in this baseline, and as the column is first taken up to temperature, and this is completely normal, but when it then it starts to decrease and levels at around 100 minutes at 380. This is when I would say that this column is conditioned and ready to run. If you don\u0026rsquo;t need to operate at that maximum temperature, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to go up to that Max Max temperature. If you\u0026rsquo;re running an analysis, say that only needs to go up to 330 degrees and you\u0026rsquo;re using a DD five MSCI there\u0026rsquo;s no need to go in to try and go up to 350 degrees to condition that column. Likewise, I\u0026rsquo;ve done some other analysis where on 64 typeface columns where I might only be going to 120 degrees, I don\u0026rsquo;t need to condition that max temperature, it\u0026rsquo;s only for where you need to operate up. So something I also like to say is like it might not be two hours, it could be less, sometime your column might be ready to run and conditioned in one hour, or it might be need a little bit longer. You don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to condition your column overnight. I know a lot of I\u0026rsquo;ve been in other places where their last thing of the day, if they would they would change a column before they left and then they would hit condition and then just set that max temperature and leave for the night and come back in the morning. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to do that. I would actually suggest if you are using you know standard phases like normally with a routine analysis. I put together a method that I call say six to four condition or WACs condition where I know how long it\u0026rsquo;s going to take where I have a ramp up, and it\u0026rsquo;s just a straight in no injection, kind of I just hit run. And then it will bring my temperature back down once it\u0026rsquo;s done. So you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have it run overnight that if you have any leaks, that could actually then be a damage to that phase. So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to go that long. So I have to make sure that we mentioned that you really want to make sure you condition that column when it\u0026rsquo;s detected or connected to your detector, don\u0026rsquo;t condition your column with that end of the column just hanging out in the oven, because so oxygen is going to start to get into that column. And it\u0026rsquo;s going to as you\u0026rsquo;re up to temperature, that heat and that oxygen we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about is going to start degrading and eating up that column phase. So you really need to make you would have to then go back, if you did that clip about a meter or two from the end of your column hope that you had like got everything, then reinstall it into your detector, install it into your detector, and then get your detector ready to run. And that is just way too much work like we have way more things to do. Your then also wasting about two meters of columns and columns can be expensive. So why why waste that meter, you aren\u0026rsquo;t going to be damaging your detector your fit or your mass spec by conditioning with that column connected to your detector it\u0026rsquo;s going to run through it\u0026rsquo;s going to be fine. Trust me, I don\u0026rsquo;t like even if you\u0026rsquo;re going up at higher temperatures. Like this is a DB five HT phase. And we like I said we went up to 380 degrees. And that\u0026rsquo;s putting a lot of stress on a column. And you can see that that baseline did decrease and it actually went back down once I decreased temperature to the state like my my starting point, so you\u0026rsquo;re not going to damage it. And it\u0026rsquo;s just going to create way much more work for you if you don\u0026rsquo;t connect it to your detector. Now one thing I also like to talk about it when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about conditioning columns and maximum temperatures is every column is going to have a different kind of bleed profile that you\u0026rsquo;re looking at. So before I used to get started, like say when I\u0026rsquo;m running a blank, I like to maybe put one kind of bleed profile for that blank injection. So if down the road, I\u0026rsquo;m wondering, did my column bleed rays, or is this normal, I can then compare it to my starting point where I know everything\u0026rsquo;s okay. Because like we said, first of all column bleed is normal, that\u0026rsquo;s a normal process. And every column is going to be a little bit different depending on what phase you\u0026rsquo;re operating at, with or the the phase ratio, the thickness, thicker the phase, the higher the column lead, you\u0026rsquo;re going to see. And also, if it is a thicker phase, you may need to condition a little bit longer. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a thinner phase column, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be have less lead, it\u0026rsquo;s just because the amount of column phase that\u0026rsquo;s on there is going to start eventually interacting with your detector. And you will see that in your background, which is why also if you\u0026rsquo;re working with mass spec, we suggest you use MS columns because that has a lower natural column bleed, because we\u0026rsquo;ve worked on that because we want it to be more lower bleed to decrease our responses and interference for using with sensitive detectors. We got if you call them bleed as normal, whatever that baseline is, that\u0026rsquo;s where I like to say, Keep a keep a chromatogram of what it looked like when it started. And then that way, if you\u0026rsquo;re down the road thinking, This doesn\u0026rsquo;t look right, well, then you can go back and then compare it to an overlay. And yeah, just, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be it\u0026rsquo;ll be good. You just don\u0026rsquo;t, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to go eight hours. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be at the max temperature always and respect the temperature limits set on the column box. Don\u0026rsquo;t exceed it. Brilliant. Thanks, Vanessa. So of course, when you talk about maximum temperature, there\u0026rsquo;s two different maximum temperatures, which are on a box, which one are you talking about here, please. So you have two temperatures, there\u0026rsquo;s the program temperature, which is or the isothermal temperature and the program temperature. So that isothermal temperature is going to be that long term, the lower temperature on the box. So say if it says to 50 to 60, that 250 degrees, that lower temperature is your isothermal temperature and that\u0026rsquo;s where that column can hang out for a long time. And that program is at higher temperature. I like to look at it in terms of lifting weights or whatnot. That lesser temperature isothermal temperature is what that lighter said a weight that you can do a lot of reps on and you\u0026rsquo;re not going to hurt yourself. You\u0026rsquo;re still going to maybe challenge yourself a little bit and whatnot. But that program temperature is your heavier weight where you\u0026rsquo;re going to do less reps, where if you tried to do that same amount before your as your lights on the way you\u0026rsquo;re gonna hurt yourself. But regardless, think about for that over a long period of time, even if you\u0026rsquo;re holding a light set away, you\u0026rsquo;re still overtime, even just if you pulled your hands out. And like you even without weights, you\u0026rsquo;re you can\u0026rsquo;t hold your arms out for a very long time, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna hurt your muscles. So same thing with our column face. So that\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;re looking at those two. So when we talk about that, I would probably try and air more towards the ice thermal temperature, because that would be the max temperature I would try to get or if you do have to operate at that program max temperature, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be for shorter periods of time, maybe 10 minute segments, just kind of pay attention, it should you can condition at that program temperature, if you are going to operate at it if you need to just kind of watch what goes on. And that might be a real good case of when you want to have that brake bleed profile in your chromatograms to just verify back to it just to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re good to go. Earlier, many thanks, Vanessa. Andy, did you have anything you want to add to that, please? My small point would be before you condition it, make sure it\u0026rsquo;s leak free. Because conditioning with leaks is not conditioning, it\u0026rsquo;s just breaking your column. or destroying your column, maybe a better statement, say you\u0026rsquo;re having if you\u0026rsquo;ve got leaks, you\u0026rsquo;ve got oxygen going in, it\u0026rsquo;s just going along and chewing on all that stationary phase. So it\u0026rsquo;s my only little caveat is leak free. And especially if it\u0026rsquo;s a mass spec, let it settle in, it\u0026rsquo;s allowed to like just let it chill and come down and leave, check it and then just like show the oxygen waters nice and low. And you know, you pass your air water check that it\u0026rsquo;s okay, yep, you know what my oxygen is under 2%. Alright, now we are ready to condition. That\u0026rsquo;s my little caveat on it. Absolutely, especially if you install a column and it hasn\u0026rsquo;t even been properly sealed. So you\u0026rsquo;re gonna have water in there, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna have oxygen in there. So don\u0026rsquo;t just put it in and ramp it straight up that conditioning temperature because you need to purge those out. But first, and especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a more polar column, like you know, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a wax column, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a lot of interactions with oxygen and moisture in there. So it\u0026rsquo;s going to take a while, you know, time to just purge those out before you start going up to really high temperatures. Because otherwise, you\u0026rsquo;re gonna get oxidation in your stationary phase and start damaging it straightaway. So I always do like a gentle, gradual up to that final temperature for my for conditioning. Absolutely. Brilliant. Thank you very much. Lots of really good tips there. So thank you. So I have got one final question here. So which has come in. So what is the most basic maintenance that a user can do to maintain the longevity of a GC? I would say because this is very wide ranging. And the biggest thing you can do is pay attention. Pay attention to your what\u0026rsquo;s happening with your GC, pay attention to your quality controls, pay attention to what you\u0026rsquo;re injecting, and also with your mass spec tune, pay attention to what\u0026rsquo;s going on kind of just be present in your analysis and how things are acting over time. Because if you\u0026rsquo;re not paying attention, if you just keep running, running, running, you could miss a lot of warning signs over time. So just if all the sudden you see your quality control, your response start to decrease. Everything may pass if you\u0026rsquo;re using internal standard, all of a sudden you see your internal standard response and everything drop. That\u0026rsquo;s an indication. If you you know, pay attention to your syringe flow or your syringe in mobility before you start an injector sequence. If you\u0026rsquo;re injecting some dirty things, I I\u0026rsquo;ve done it myself where I haven\u0026rsquo;t checked that and then all of a sudden my first or second injection and then z\u0026rsquo;s, and I have to replace it. You know, just pay attention. That\u0026rsquo;s the biggest thing. Right, thanks, Andy. Do you have any tips, please? Yeah, I was gonna be like, oh, sure you change your lighter but Vanessa\u0026rsquo;s point is a lot better is actually last week. I was working on my I was remoting into my system from home. And looking at it like oh man, this syringe must be z because I\u0026rsquo;m seeing like nothing in my mass spec. Or like my total and chromatic I\u0026rsquo;m like, oh, man, it\u0026rsquo;s broken. Stop the sequence. They\u0026rsquo;ll deal with it later. And I look at it and I\u0026rsquo;m like, Wait, my mass spec pressure is way higher than it supposed to be, you know my mass spec pressure and I try to keep an eye on it because I am paranoid about numbers is usually like nine times 10 to the negative six and that\u0026rsquo;s just where that one usually sits out. I\u0026rsquo;m like this two times 10 to the negative it will their event. There\u0026rsquo;s something wrong let\u0026rsquo;s event and and I was chatting with a colleague and she Like, yeah, there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, Okay, let me run a diagnostic test on the inlet quick. So nice part of the ad series on GCS is we can do a web UI and do some diagnostics, I click no inlet pressure and leak restriction test. Okay, it passes the pressure. And then the leak says it\u0026rsquo;s 92 mils per minute. And I\u0026rsquo;m like, there\u0026rsquo;s a huge problem there. So I, you know, everything got kind of turned down, and I went in the next morning, I checked the inlet and like, turned out, you know, and that\u0026rsquo;s fine, like in the oven, and there\u0026rsquo;s a column break, like, half a meter, maybe a meter from the inlet, and I\u0026rsquo;m like, Ah, but if I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have paid attention to that pressure, I could have been like, Oh, I\u0026rsquo;ll be with that. Tomorrow, whatever. But luckily, I knew my system well enough to say, there\u0026rsquo;s a huge problem. Let me cool it off, let me vent it, and I prevented, you know, burning out anything on my mass spec, but just stopping waiting and saying, Vince, you know, you know, obviously, I\u0026rsquo;d replaced calm is broken, but you know, better to find it, then then find it out 24 hours later, and then you gotta wait the cool and, you know, 15 other things. So, I think Vanessa is probably the best advice for keeping longevity is pay attention. You know, the first time you set up your system, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to know is that normal? Is that normal, write it down, and try and just be like, alright, this is what it starts at, hey, I let it sit for 24 hours, this is this is what the new normal, okay, and then just track from there. And it is annoying that every systems a little bit different. Well, that mess back likes to sit it nine times 10 to the negative six, my triple quad likes to sit it, you know, two times 10 to the negative fifths. So I need, I need to make sure that, you know, my brain keeps those separate. So we have a little bit of a pain in the neck, but pay attention. Knowledge he sees are individuals, and this is why I give them names. That\u0026rsquo;s true. That sounds like the same thing. They\u0026rsquo;ve all got their own little characters, and it\u0026rsquo;s getting to know them, the better you know them, the better you can see when they\u0026rsquo;re not well, like having pets really isn\u0026rsquo;t that you know, you get to know their little quirks. And then, you know, when they\u0026rsquo;re not doing their normal quirks are doing something different, you kind of like right in there, or what\u0026rsquo;s happening here, maybe off to the vets or something like that. But I mean, for me, I would say one of the tips is have looking out for dirt. If you can see where dirt is you can really understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on the system, but also where else you need to go and do maintenance. So you know, what do you go and change your life and don\u0026rsquo;t just throw it away, take it out and examine it, you know, if you\u0026rsquo;ve got some glass wall in there, the dirt sits on top of the glass, well, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s gone no further, the dirt underneath that glass wall, it\u0026rsquo;s probably gone down further, maybe a head of the column needs to trim and stuff because it hasn\u0026rsquo;t all been trapped. If you feel dirt on the outside of your liner, you know, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to take out the column and give your inside of your inlet a really good claim. So you know, I love Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t know I don\u0026rsquo;t like that. But I love looking for and using it to track where other potential problems are. So you know, don\u0026rsquo;t just throw things away look. And again, when you take your septum out, look underneath is that coring under there. There\u0026rsquo;s coring underneath it is the set under your septum. It\u0026rsquo;s most likely it\u0026rsquo;s little bits have gone inside your liners. Now you need to go and take your liner out, because otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll be analyzing those bits as well. So yeah, track that judge. Absolutely. So brilliant. Thank you very much for answering these great questions. Yeah, we\u0026rsquo;ve had some really, really interesting ones. So thanks to everyone. Well, thank you, Diane, and Vanessa, and Angie for that excellent discussion. We\u0026rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground over the past hour, and hopefully helped with some of the issues you face in your GC and GC ms analysis. We do know that there are plenty more questions still to address. And we look forward to doing that in the next part of this series. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget if you have a GCL GCMs question, you can still submit it using the Ask a Question button below. We\u0026rsquo;ll try to accommodate some of these in our follow up future sessions. Thanks also to our scientific partners in this event being Agilent for all their technical input and support. a recorded version of today\u0026rsquo;s discussion will be available soon. You\u0026rsquo;ll all receive a link to this as soon as it\u0026rsquo;s ready. And so with that, I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank you all for logging in and listening today.

The pH of the mobile phase determines the presence of ionizable compounds (analytes and matrix) to be in either an ionized or non-ionized state. The ionized species in reverse phase (RP) chromatography always elute from the column earlier than the non-ionized species. Changing the pH can also increase the selectivity for effective separation of closely eluting or overlapping peaks. Run-to-run variability in pH results in a separation inconsistency. Buffers prevent pH variations. Therefore, the proper buffer choice, in terms of buffering species, ionic strength, and pH, is the most critical step in HPLC method development when ionizable substances are analysed.\nTips for choosing an LC buffer\nBuffer selection. The choice of the appropriate buffer for an application is governed by the buffer characteristics such as pKa, pH range, and UV cut-off. As a rule, buffers should be used for a pH within +/- 1 unit of their pKa value. Within this range, buffers resist any deliberate attempts of change in pH. The buffer’s capacity is at its maximum when its pH is equal to its pKa. The UV cut-off value also needs to be considered, as the detection wavelength should not interfere with the buffer absorbance (significant absorbance: trifluoroacetic acid \u0026lt;220 nm; formic acid, acetic acid \u0026lt;240 nm). For the best results with an ionizable analyte of interest, use a buffer with a pH at least 2 units away from the analyte\u0026rsquo;s pKa. If the pH of the mobile phase is too close to the analyte’s pKa, split peaks or shoulders might be observed due to the presence of both species in the sample. For several ionizable analytes of interest, it is preferable to choose a pH value wherein all the analytes exist in the same form, either ionized or non-ionized.\nMeasuring buffer pH. pH of the buffer is the pH of the aqueous portion before the organic mobile phase part is added. The addition of an organic solvent can shift the pH either up or down (pH shift should be consistent for the same buffer). It is not so important to know the exact pH value of the buffer in an organic medium, but it is important to have a consistent pH value (because pKa of your analytes is also determined in aqueous phase, and we do not know the individual pKa shifts either).\nChemical Purity. The quality/purity of mobile phase additives (buffers, salts, acids, and bases) along with organic solvents utilized in an HPLC experiment must be adapted to the detector sensitivity and elution protocol.\nChemical Compatibility. Buffer composition, along with mobile phase pH, must be chosen in agreement with column housing material and nature of the stationary as well as different parts of LC instrument (pumps, tubing\u0026rsquo;s, etc.) phase to prevent corrosion or degradation of either.\nMS compatibility. Introducing inorganic buffer salts into a mass spectrometer soon fouls the system. Examples of suitable volatile buffers are ammonium acetate, ammonium formate, and ammonium citrate. pH modifiers like formic acid and acetic acid should be used to control pH and help ionization for LC-MS.\nBuffer Solubility . Ideally, the buffer should be completely water-soluble (RP methods) and should not precipitate during the analysis when mixed with a chosen organic solvent. Buffer concentration must therefore be carefully chosen to avoid precipitation at higher concentrations in the organic solvent. If neglected, this can create operational problems with the pumps and instigate HPLC column blockage or backpressure rise.\nBuffer Ionic Strength. In case of ionic interactions between analytes and stationary phase, the ionic strength of the buffer must be chosen in a way that compounds are eluted. The required ionic strength of the buffer depends on the stationary phase. Besides elution strength, the viscosity of the buffer plays an important role in terms of its suitability for use in HPLC analyses.\nBuffer Concentration. Ideally, the lowest concentration that gives reproducible results should be chosen. Higher concentrations lead to a faster elution of polar molecules. Generally, the buffer concentration should not be lower than 5 mM. Below this concentration, the solution may not perform as a buffer (depending on analyte concentration and buffering capability). Raising the buffer concentration can increase viscosity and the risk of buffer precipitation, which in turn can increase column back pressure. Commonly, the concentration should be kept in the 5 to 100 mM range. A concentration higher than 100 mM of mineral salt buffers wear out the pump’s movable parts faster, therefore a back-seal wash is recommended to be installed.\nIt can be observed that buffers play a crucial role in a majority of HPLC separations. Method development often requires careful selection of buffers and adequate care in their preparation. So, the general rules to be kept in mind are― buffer solutions must be homogeneous, clear, and free from any particles. If stored, please keep in mind that buffers have a limited lifetime, so consider their preparation daily.\nIn case of any chromatography challenges, please contact me at Analytix@milliporesigma.com\n"},{"id":173,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-06-Instrumentation-Troubleshooting/15_Change_in_selectivity/","title":"Change in Selectivity","section":"Part 06 Instrumentation Troubleshooting Guide in General","content":"Figure : \rProblem: Change in Selectivity\r\r\r\rProblem\nProbable Cause\nRemedy/Comments\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r1.

Theory of LC Column Separation #  The actual separation occurs inside the LC column. You may be wondering what is happening inside the column. Let\u0026rsquo;s use \u0026ldquo;after-work activity\u0026rdquo; as an example to explain the column separation.\nFigure : After-work Activity\rOne evening at 6pm, three people, a researcher, a business man, and an office worker were leaving their work. The office worker goes straight home, and arrives home at 7pm. A business man went to a restaurant with his coworker and had a wine. They decided to go to a bar to have few drinks after eating. Then the business man went home at 9pm. The researcher went to a bar after work and had a beer, met someone who also likes drinking. They moved to another bar next door had few more beer. The researcher met his friends at the bar and they decided to go to a Karaoke bar and had another drink. Everyone else went home, but the researcher stopped by at a nearby bar. He drunk till the bar closed and finally went home at midnight. From the view point of home arriving time, we can tell who likes drinking or not: Non-drinker office worker, social-drinker business man, and heavy-drinker researcher. So how this story is relevant to the LC column separation?\nThe LC column is filled with very small particles (also called gels), and the size of gel is 3 to 15μm (μm=1/1000mm) or smaller. This gel has various \u0026ldquo;traps\u0026rdquo;. Each sample component has different \u0026ldquo;characteristics\u0026rdquo; and interacts with the \u0026ldquo;trap\u0026rdquo; differently, i.e., each component may stay inside the column for different lengths. Thus using this time differences, the components are separated.\nIf we were to go back to the after-work activity story, the bars are the traps and each person\u0026rsquo;s drinking taste is the characteristics. Because of this difference in their characteristics, the \u0026ldquo;type separation\u0026rdquo; was possible. However, by changing the conditions, the separation can be changed. For example, the office worker may have gone to a restaurant to have a glass of wine if he was meeting his friends. Or the researcher may have gone home if he had to attend a conference next day. The condition change, in case of LC, is to change compositions of mobile phase, pH, column temperatures etc… By changing the conditions, the components which were not able to be separated may be separated or could be vice versa. This is the difficult point of LC and where the user needs to pay a big attention. In some cases the same \u0026ldquo;trap\u0026rdquo; with different conditions may make the separation possible, but in other cases, the same \u0026ldquo;trap\u0026rdquo; does not work at any conditions you try. In the latter case, different kind of trap may be required. In \u0026ldquo;LC word\u0026rdquo;, the former means that using the same column with different conditions (mobile phase/ temperature etc\u0026hellip;) and the latter case means to change the LC column. There are different LC column packing materials (base material) available. Moreover using different modifications (addition of chemical compounds on the surface of the gel), a wide variety of LC column can be prepared.\n2. HPLC Separation #  Ideally, obtained LC separation result should provide a symmetrical peak shape (Figure 2a). When there is a problem, the peak will not be a symmetrical one and may show leading (Figure 2b) or tailing (Figure 2c). The high-performance column will provide narrower peak (Figure 3a) and low-performance column will provide wider peak (Figure 3b). To measure the performance of the column, we use \u0026ldquo;theoretical plate number (TPN)\u0026rdquo;. It can be said that the bigger the TPN, the better the column. TPN is directly proportional to the column length, i.e., if the column length was doubled or two columns were used in a series, the TPN is also doubled. The internal diameter of the column also influences the TPN, but it is not as significant as that of column length. Also TPN may differ if different LC settings or measurement methods were used, even using the same column and the same mobile phase. For the separation of two components in the sample, it is ideal to have separation at the baseline level (Figure 4a). When two peaks are too close, they may overwrap, and results in insufficient separation (Figure 4b-c). The column with higher TPN provides sharper peaks, thus the possibility of overwrapping is smaller than the column with lower TPN.\nEven when peak overwrapping was observed, this may be solved by changing the analytical conditions (e.g. changing mobile phase). If the separation cannot be improved by the conditional changes, different types of LC column may be used.\nFor the qualification analysis (to identify what components are present in the sample), peak overwrapping may not be a big concern. However, for the quantification analysis (to measure how much each sample is present in the sample), the baseline separation is required for the precise measurement.\n3. Types of packed gels #  3.1 Silica gel #  Silica gel is the most popularly used packing material. Silica, silicon dioxide, has the chemical formula of $\\textrm{SiO}_2$. You may see a small paper bag of silica in food packages stated \u0026lsquo;do not eat\u0026rsquo;. It is used as a dehydrator. The ones used for dehydrator has a gel diameter of 1 mm or larger, but the ones packed in LC columns are very small; few μm sizes. There are two types of silica gels. The one has spherical shapes, the other has irregular shapes. Unlike past, the spherical shaped gels are most widely used these days. The silica gel used in LC has pores on the surface of the gel. By having the pores, it provides larger surface area compared to the ones without pores. The size of pore is very small and expressed in angstrom ($\\mathring{A}$) unit. The silica with pores is called porous silica.\nThere are few indexes used to express silica gel grades.\nShape : Most silica columns used nowadays contain spherical type.\nSize : Smaller size particles have been developed. Current major line is 5μm, but even smaller size 1.5 to 3μm gel is also in use. The smaller gels are packed in smaller column housing and thus decreases the analytical time.\nPore size : There is not a simple good/bad indicator for pore sizes. The right pore size should be determined depending on the size of target analyte.\nSurface area : This is the relative surface area of the gel. The smaller the particle size, the relative surface area becomes larger. Also the larger the number of pores, the larger the relative surface area. If all the other indexes are the same, the better performance can be expected from the larger surfaced-area gel. One gram of conventional silica gel provides a surface area of softball field.\n3.2 Polymer gel #  In the earlier stage of HPLC development, almost always silica gels were used. However, polymer-based column is becoming popular. The generally known polymers include polyethylene and poly propylene. Several different types of polymers can be found in columns as listed below.\n(1) Polystylene (Styrene divinylbenzene copolymer)\n(2) Polymethacrylate\n(3) Polyhydroxymethacrylate\n(4) Polyvinyl alcohol\nSimilar to the silica gel, the polymer gel is manufactured into very small particles.\n3.3 Other gel #  Other than silica and polymer gels, the gels used include natural substances such as cellulose, agarose, dextrin, and chitosan, and members of ceramics such as hydroxyapatite and zirconia. However, their use is very limited.\n4. Types of separation mode #  As explained earlier, there are many different types of \u0026ldquo;traps\u0026rdquo; in the column, and depending on the \u0026ldquo;trap\u0026rdquo; there are different types of columns. This \u0026ldquo;trap\u0026rdquo; is called separation mode. Generally used separation modes in LC are listed below.\n(1) Reversed-phase (RP) mode\n(2) Normal-phase (NP) mode\n(3) Hydrophilic Interaction (HILIC) mode\n(4) Ion exchange (IE) mode\n(5) Ligand exchange mode\n(6) Ion exclusion mode\n(7) GPC mode\n(8) GFC mode\n(9) Multi mode\n(10) Affinity mode\n(11) Chiral mode\nSection 2: Partition/Adsorption Chromatography Columns #  1. Reversed-Phase Column #  1.1 ODS column #  The packing material used for reversed-phase column is often made of silica gel modified with functional group. In the story of after work activities (Section 1), people may go for a drink by knowing the bar, but if there is a promoter standing in front of the bar, handing out flyers, more people may stop by for a drink. This promoter is the functional group in RP column. The most often used functional group is octadecyl. Octadecyl functional group is a straight carbon chain of 18. Its molecular structure is shown below.\nIt is also often called C18 (C eighteen) column. The name of octadecyl is originated from octa meaning number 8 and deci meaning number 10. A numerous number of this hydrocarbon chain is attached on the surface of silica gel. By looking at the structure written above, it may look like a very long chain, but compare to the size of silica gel, it is actually small. Thus, an infinite number of chains can be modified on one silica gel. More over these chains are modified even inside of the silica-gel pores. Back to our \u0026ldquo;famous\u0026rdquo; story, some people may pick-up the flyer, but others may not pay any attention. Similarly, some compounds may \u0026ldquo;stopped\u0026rdquo; by the functional group, but others may not. This defines the eluting timing of each component. By using more scientific words, it can be said \u0026ldquo;a separation is a result of different affinity between the gel and the components in the sample\u0026rdquo;. This affinity is called \u0026ldquo;partition\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;adsorption\u0026rdquo; thus this type of separation is also called partition/adsorption chromatography. Precisely speaking, reversed phase mode is a part of partition/adsorption mode.\nThe gel made of silica-base and modified with octadecyl functional group is called octadecyl silica (ODS) gel. Also the column packed with ODS gel is called ODS column (or called C18 column). Among the silica-based column available in the market, about 80% of them are ODS columns.\nIdeally, entire surface of ODS gel is modified with C18 functional group; however there will be remaining spaces that are not modified. Those part are called \u0026ldquo;residual silanol\u0026rdquo; and the presence of residual silanols can influence the separation. Often \u0026ldquo;end capping\u0026rdquo; is applied to the gels to immobilize the residual silanol. Almost all ODS columns nowadays are end-capped, however depending on the type of analyte, presence of silanol may provide better separation results.\n1.2 Other Silica-Based Columns #  ODS is most popularly used RP column, however since C18 is a long chain, it may retain compounds too much and consequently results in long analysis time. So in those cases, it is better to use functional group with shorter chain, such as C8, C4, and C3.\nC8 : Octyl functional group -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3\nC4 : Butyl functional group -CH2CH2CH2CH3\nC3 : Trimethyl functional group -CH2CH2CH3\nAlso there are silica gels modified with phenyl and cyanopropyl functional groups.\n1.3 Polymer-Based Columns #  As mentioned earlier, ODS (silica base) is the most dominant column for RP column. Although polymer-based columns have also been used. Polymer-based columns have some differences compared to silica-based columns.\n• Long column life\nIn general, polymer gel is chemically more stable than silica gel. It is difficult to predict a column life, since it largely depends on how and under what conditions the column is used. Despite that the column life of silica column is about 3 months whereas it is not surprising to see a polymer column provides stable analysis over 1 year.\n• Good repeatability\nGel to gel lot difference of silica gel can be large, whereas that of polymer gel is smaller, since it is relatively easy to control the polymer gel production. From column user’s view point, the analytical performance of a new column is expected to be the same as old column, i.e., negligible level of lot-to-lot difference.\n• Usability under alkaline conditions\nSilica column cannot be used under alkaline conditions where polymer column can. Some basic samples (often pharmaceutical compounds) require alkaline mobile phase to obtain good separations, thus polymer columns are suitable for such analysis. In another case, columns might be clogged with impurities. Silica columns have very small chance of regeneration, but since polymer column can be cleaned with alkaline solvent, it may be possible to remove the impurities and regenerated.\n• Resolution and price General consensus is that polymer columns compared to silica columns are more expensive and provide less resolution. Therefore even though polymer columns have several advantages over silica columns, former is less often used. The price of the polymer column is becoming lower as the technology has been improved. Also considering the longer column life, from a long term point of view, polymer column is not extremely more expensive than silica columns. The biggest concern will be the resolution. However, again the performance of newer polymer column has been improved and is becoming very comparable to silica columns.\n Shodex has strength in development of polymer-based RP columns. The most popular Shodex polymer column is ODP series. As you may guess, the name of ODP came from OctaDecyl Polymer. We believe it is easy to remember, as S (silica) in ODS was simply replaced with P (polymer). The next popular polymer-based RP column is DE-413. The packing gel is made of polymethacrylate. What unique about this gel is that is not modified with any functional group. Instead of using the characteristics of modified functional group, the interaction occurs between the sample and the natural characteristics of polymethacrylate. The question about selection of ODP vs. DE-413 is depends on the sample, you may find many applications on our website to see when ODP/DE-413 is suitable.\n 2. Normal-Phase Column #  It is rather complicated to explain detailed-theoretical differences between RP and normal phase, thus we will keep it simple here as an introduction. Gels and mobile phases used for HPLC analysis have different polarities. Water and oil is a famous example of something does not mix: Water is categorized as something with high polarity while oil is categorized as something with low polarity. Oil is a type of carbohydrate, made of carbon and hydrogen; such compound has low polarity. In contrast, water is made of oxygen and hydrogen; such compound has higher polarity. Silica gel without modification has high polarity, but when C18 functional group is modified, the polarity becomes low. RP mode uses gel with low polarity (e.g., ODS) and mobile phase with high polarity (e.g., water, acetonitrile). Normal-phase mode uses gel with high polarity (e.g. silica) and mobile phase with low polarity (e.g. hexane, chloroform). Instead of using the word low or high polarity, it is also common to use words, hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Something easy to dissolve in water (i.e., high polarity) is called hydrophilic and something easy to dissolve in oil (i.e., low polarity) is called hydrophobic.\nAt the very early stage of HPLC development, silica gel without any functional group was only used. Thus, historically normal-phase mode was developed first and so named \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo;. Then the separation mode which uses opposite separation theory to normal phase was developed and named \u0026ldquo;Reversed\u0026rdquo;. RP mode is much more popularly used than normal phase nowadays, but we cannot change the historical background, and thus they are still called normal and reversed-phase modes.\n3. Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) Column #  HILIC is a relatively new concept as a member of partition chromatography. It is considered as a part of normal phase because of its high polarity on the gel surface. The base material can be either silica or polymer and they may be modified with different types of polar functionalities such as amide, amino, diol, and cyano. Compared to normal mode, the mobile phase used for HILIC is very similar to RP mode mobile phase such as mixture of water and acetonitrile. From practical view point, HILIC sits somehow between the RP and normal mode separation. Hydrophilic compounds that were “too polar” to be retained by RP can be analyzed by HILIC using the mobile phase similar to RP condition. Because of this feature HILIC is popularly used for the separation of carbohydrates, especially saccharide which is hydrophilic.\n4. Summary of Shodex Partition/Adsorption Columns #  Figure # is a summary of Shodex partition/adsorption type columns. X-axis is the polarity of gel; column on the right side is lower polar and left side is higher polar. i.e., the column on right side is used for RP mode and left side is for the normal phase mode. Y-axis is the pore size of the gel. For the analysis of large components, gels with larger pore-size should be selected and vice versa.\nSection 3: Guard Columns #  The presence of impurities in the sample may cause alternation of column by being deposited inside the column permanently. To prevent such problems, it is necessary to pre-treat the sample by centrifugion and/or filtration. However, there are components that cannot be removed by centrifugion/filtration. If those samples were injected, it may break the column.\nThe guard column is effective preventing the analytical column from being alternated by those impurities. The guard column is a smaller version of the analytical column; packed with the same type of gels as that is in analytical column. The guard column is placed before the analytical column, thus any potential impurities that may cause damages is trapped inside the guard column before it reaches the analytical column. The price of a guard column is generally about one third to one tenth of the analytical column. By using the guard column, it can enhance the analytical column life and thus can be more economical. Although for the relatively low-priced analytical columns, the price of guard column compared to the analytical column could be high. Thus for those columns, the corresponding guard column may not be available. Moreover, the use of guard column is more effective for the polymer-based columns that have expected long column lives compared to silica-based columns.\nSource #   https://www.shodex.com/en/kouza/\n Figure : \r"},{"id":179,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-04-GLP-for-HPLC/02_Buffer_prep/","title":"Chapter 02 Buffer","section":"Part 04 Good Lab Practice for HPLC","content":"Buffer #  All buffers should be prepared freshly on the day required.

In addition, the polarity of the phase will also contribute to the overall selectivity observed.\nHydrophobicity\nThe strength of hydrophobic interaction can be measured by the retention of neutral (non-polar) molecules. The k values (retention factors) for a neutral species, for a given C18 phase, will give an indication of the surface area and surface coverage (ligand density) of the silica.\nThe percentage of carbon in the material is a simplistic but useful guide to the hydrophobic retention characteristics of a column. In Figure 1 this loose correlation is demonstrated by the increase in retention observed when alkyl chain length (i.e. carbon load) is increased. This increase results from an increase in hydrophobicity of the stationary phase. Similarly, an increase in retention would be expected in going from a C18 phase with a low carbon load to one of high carbon load.\nHydrophobic selectivity can be determined from the retention factor ratio between two neutral species. This is a better measure of surface coverage than carbon content, as surface area and porosity may vary from silica to silica.\nPolarity\nThe second key property of C18 materials is their silanol activity, often discussed in terms of polarity. This can be determined by measuring the retention factor ratio between a basic and an acidic compound. At pH \u0026gt;7 the total ion-exchange capacity will correspond to a measure of the total silanol activity. At acidic pH (e.g. pH 2.7) an indication of the acidic activity of the silanol groups can be obtained. The presence of metal ions in the base silica increases the level of silanol activity. Older generation silicas have higher and less tightly controlled levels of metal ions, and hence higher silanol activity compared to newer generation alkyl bonded phases. For this and other reasons, it is strongly recommended that new method development should be approached using newer generation higher purity silicas.\nHigh Purity Base Deactivated Phases\nModern alkyl bonded phases have very low cumulative metal ion levels within the base silica (\u0026lt;10ppm), resulting in the number of isolated silanol groups, and hence the polarity of the silica surface, also being reduced. Combined with more effective and reproducible bonding processes, these newer generation reversed-phase materials lead to significantly improved chromatography for the more basic polar solute molecules. The use of bonded alkyl groups containing hydrophilic substituents (i.e. polar embedded) can either enhance this effect and/or offer alternative selectivity.\nOptimizing Selectivity\nFigure 2 illustrates the relationship between the change in polarity and hydrophobicity for typical C18, C8, and C4 materials, showing a decrease in hydrophobicity on reducing alkyl chain length. Greater ligand density, and hence lower polarity, is also seen as the length of the alkyl chain is reduced. However, changing the alkyl chain length may reduce analysis time but will not significantly affect selectivity. Changing the chemistry to an alternative bonded phase is a more powerful tool to achieve this.\nOlder Generation ‘Traditional’ Phases\nThe older ‘traditional’ C18 phases are hydrophobic and have a high polarity due to the lower purity silica containing a higher level of acidic silanol groups on which they are based. The use of the newer high purity silicas reduces the resultant phases’ silanol activity and improves reproducibility. Employing a polar embedded functionality may also result in a reduced polarity material. For basic solutes that will interact strongly with surface silanols, lower polarity phases are generally recommended. However, for certain analyses, the additional interactions provided by the surface silanols of a ‘traditional’ C18 material may be beneficial to the overall separation.\nPhenyl Reversed-phase Column #  Phenyl bonded silica phases offer an alternative reversed-phase selectivity to alkyl bonded phases. They show lower hydrophobic retention than their C18 counterparts, with similar retention characteristics to C8-bonded phases. Phenyl stationary phases interact with compounds containing aromatic groups or unsaturated bonds through the involvement of π-π interactions. For aromatic solutes containing an electronegative atom or group (e.g. F, NO2), the degree of π-π interactions with the phenyl phase will increase.\nDue to the rigid nature of the phenyl ring, the solute shape can also influence selectivity.\nTraditional phenyl phases tend to be less stable than the corresponding C8 or C18 reversed-phases. Additionally, the larger steric size of the phenyl group reduces surface coverage, leaving a greater number of exposed silanol sites. More recently introduced phenyl phases show greater stability. The use of a purer silica base, more effective and reproducible bonding procedures and the availability of a sterically protected phenyl silane all contribute to greater phase robustness and reduced column bleed.\nConventional phenyl phases are bonded to the silica through a propyl spacer. The incorporation of the longer chain hexyl spacer results in increased hydrophobic retention and aromatic selectivity.\nPolar Bonded Silica Phases #  Polar bonded silica phases offer an alternative selectivity to alkyl bonded materials. In general, they have a lower hydrophobicity but higher polarity. Cyano, amino and diol bonded phases can be used in both normal- and reversed-phase modes. In normal-phase, they equilibrate more rapidly with the eluent than silica itself and are not deactivated by traces of water.\nCyano bonded phases show unique selectivity for polar compounds and are more suitable than bare silica for normal-phase gradient separations. The cyano functional group is a strong dipole that can interact with other dipoles or induce dipoles on solutes. These phases also exhibit moderate hydrophobicity due to the alkyl linker.\nAmino bonded phases show alternative normal-phase selectivity to unbonded silica, especially for aromatics. Amino columns are also used in the HILIC mode for carbohydrate analysis and for other polar compounds. Their weak anion-exchange properties can be used in the analysis of anions and organic acids.\nDiol bonded phases are a versatile alternative to unbonded silica for normal-phase separations. The hydroxyl groups provide good selectivity without excessive retention since H-bonding with the diol layer is weaker than with silanols. Some diol bonded phases have been developed specifically for HILIC applications. Differing pore size materials are used in size-exclusion separations.\n Figure : \r"},{"id":182,"href":"/docs/94-Database/Part-01-Columns/02_USP_spec_HPLC_columns/","title":"Chapter 02 USP Specifications for LC Columns","section":"Part 01 Columns","content":"Figure : \rUSP Specifications for LC Columns The USP specifications are listed below with the appropriate Thermo Scientific columns listed for your convenience.

The Van Deemter equation is governed by three cumulative terms: (A) eddy diffusion, (B) longitudinal diffusion, and (C) mass transfer.\nThe plate height H is a measure of column efficiency. Smaller plate height values corresponds to greater peak efficiencies, as more plates, or analyte partitioning, can occur over a fixed length of column. A loss in peak efficiency can be observed as a wider analyte band, and therefore, these three terms can be viewed as factors that contribute to band broadening.\nFigure 1 illustrates the effect of these terms, both individually and cumulatively. Eddy diffusion, the A term, is caused by a turbulence in the solute flow path and is mainly unaffected by flow rate.\nLongitudinal diffusion, or difference, the B, term, is the movement of an analyte molecule outward from the center to the edges of its band. Higher column velocities will limit this outward distribution, keeping the band tighter.\nMass transfer, the C term, is the movement of analyte, or transfer of its mass, between the mobile and stationary phases. Through this type of diffusion, increased flows have been observed to widen analyte bands, or lower peak efficiencies.\nFigure 1: The Van Deemter Equation describes the relationship between column flow rate and peak efficiency, referred to as band broadening.\rDecreasing particle size has been observed to limit the effect of flow rate on peak efficiency—smaller particles have shorter diffusion path lengths, allowing a solute to travel in and out of the particle faster. Therefore the analyte spends less time inside the particle where peak diffusion can occur. Figure 2 illustrates the Van Deemter plots for various particle sizes. We notice that as the particle size decreases, the curve becomes flatter, or less affected by higher column flow rates. Smaller particle sizes yield better overall efficiencies, or less peak dispersion, across a much wider range of usable flow rates.\nFigure 2: Smaller particle sizes yield higher overall peak efficiencies and a much wider range of usable flow rates.\rIf we look at an empirically determined Van Deemter plot of efficiency versus flow rate, when using a 1.9µm particle size Pinnacle DB column (Figure 3), the benefit is apparent—column efficiency does not diminish when flow rate increases, as denoted by the relatively flat slope of the curve. Peak efficiency was comparable even when the flow was increased to 1mL/min. This illustrates the most considerable affect that small particles have on chromatographic separations—a much wider range of usable flow rates translates into significantly faster analysis times. This benefit, coupled with a shorter column length needed for similar resolution, allows much higher sample throughput, without the compromising the chromatographic quality of the analytical method.\nFigure 3: An empirically determined Van Deemter plot shows that column efficiency does not diminish as flow rate increases on a 1.9 µm particle size Pinnacle DB column — significantly reducing analysis time and increasing sample throughput.\r Explain in my words: An analyte molecule moves along a column with three behaviour pattern: 1) turbulent diffusion (Eddy diffusion), 2) longitudinal diffusion, 3) mass transfer.\n Turbulent diffusion (涡流扩散): Solute molecules will take different paths through the stationary phase at random.1    Figure 4: Eddy Diffusion  Figure 5: Eddy Diffusion\rFigure 6: Eddy Diffusion\rFigure 4 - 6 are downloaded from http://www.ecs.umass.edu/cee/reckhow/courses/772/slides/772l14p.pdf.\nResource\n Longitudinal diffusion: Analyte diffuses out from the center to the edges.

They can originate from:\n electrical interferences, detector faults, solvent impurities, column contamination etc.  To isolate the source of a baseline irregularity, it is important to determine whether the problem lies with the fluid path, detector or electrical connections. This can be achieved by following the simple steps below:\n  Turn off the instrument pump – fluid flow must be zero\n  Monitor the baseline for 5 to 10 minutes. Note if there is any improvement in the baseline’s appearance. If yes, then the problem lies within the instrument fluid path.

Seals, plungers etc. can be damaged by extreme pH conditions.\nThe HPLC column has been engineered to accommodate highly aqueous solvents – traditional alkyl chain media can be prone to phase collapse in low organic composition solvent mixes, for example at less than 5% organic solvent.\nHighly aqueous mobile phases are ideal breeding grounds for microbes. Ensure that an organic solvent is flushed through the HPLC system and column at least once every 48 hours to kill unwanted microbial growth. Alternatively add a small amount of sodium azide to the aqueous solvent to inhibit growth.\nNote: Never allow a HPLC column or system to stand with water or buffer in it for an extended period of time (for example, over a holiday break). Always flush with a solvent mix that contains a minimum of 20% organic in water.\nSigma-Aldrich Guide #  Low sensitivity and rising baselines, noise, or spikes on the chromatogram can often be attributed to the mobile phase. Contaminants in the mobile phase are especially troublesome in gradient elution. The baseline may rise, and spurious peaks can appear as the level of the contaminated component increases.\nWater is the most common source of contamination in reversed phase analyses. You should use only high purity distilled or deionized water when formulating mobile phases. However, several common deionizers introduce organic contaminants into the water. To remove these contaminants, pass the deionized water through activated charcoal or a preparative C18 column.\nUse only HPLC grade solvents, salts, ion pair reagents, and base and acid modifiers. Cleaning lower quality solvents is time consuming, and trace levels of contaminants often remain. These trace contaminants can cause problems when you use a high sensitivity ultraviolet or fluorescence detector.\nBecause many aqueous buffers promote the growth of bacteria or algae, you should prepare these solutions fresh, and filter them (0.2 μm or 0.45 μm filter) before use. Filtering also will remove particles that could produce a noisy baseline, or plug the column. Prevent microorganism growth by adding about 100 ppm of sodium azide to aqueous buffers. Alternatively, these buffers may also be mixed with 20% or more of an organic solvent such as ethanol or acetonitrile.\nTo prevent bubbles in the system, degas the mobile phase. Generally, an in-line degasser is a first choice, but sparging with helium can be an alternative if the mobile phase does not contain any volatile components.\nUse ion pair reagents carefully. The optimum chain length and concentration of the reagent must be determined for each analysis. Concentrations can be as low as 0.2 mM, or as high as 150 mM, or more. In general, increasing the concentration or chain length increases retention times. High concentrations (\u0026gt;50%) of acetonitrile or some other organic solvents can precipitate ion pair reagents. Also, some salts of ion pair reagents are insoluble in water and will precipitate. Avoid this by using sodium-containing buffers in the presence of long chain sulfonic acids (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate), instead of potassium-containing buffers.\nVolatile basic and acidic modifiers, such as triethylamine (TEA) and trifluoracetic acid (TFA), are useful when you wish to recover a compound for further analysis. These modifiers also let you avoid problems associated with ion pair reagents. They can be added to the buffer at concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0% TEA or 0.01 to 0.15% TFA. Increasing the concentration may improve peak shape for certain compounds, but can alter retention times.\nRecycling the mobile phase used for isocratic separations has become more popular as a means of reducing the cost of solvents, their disposal, and mobile phase preparation time. A solvent recovery apparatus uses a microprocessor controlled switching valve to direct the solvent stream to waste when a peak is detected. When the baseline falls under the selected threshold, uncontaminated solvent is directed back to the solvent reservoir.\n Source: Sigma-Aldrich\n"},{"id":187,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-01-Theory/03_Reverse-Phase_Chromatogrphy/","title":"Chapter 03 Reversed-phase Chromatography","section":"Part I Theory","content":"Michael W. Dong, HPLC and UHPLC For Practicing Scientists, 2nd Edition #  RPC Theory and Fundamentals #  Under RPC conditions, proteins and peptides are separated based on their hydrophobicity and their interaction with the hydrophobic ligands in the stationary phases (see Section 1.2.2). The stationary phase ligands are typically composed of carbon chains of varying lengths, from 4 carbons (C4 phase) to 18 carbons (C18 bonded phase), with the longer carbon chains providing a stationary phase with higher hydrophobicity. Other ligands such as diphenyl are also commonly utilized. RPC of proteins and peptides typically uses higher temperatures and organic solvents, which denature the proteins and expose the hydrophobic cores. The use of shallow gradients is common since the variants tend to elute in a very narrow gradient segment. The pore size of the support material is also important, with large proteins such as antibodies using 300$\\mathring{A}$ pore materials, while small proteins or peptides are better resolved in columns packed with smaller pore supports (e.g. 120 $\\mathring{A}$ ). The phenomenon of “entangled diffusion” of large proteins in small-pore support materials leading to poor mass transfer and band broadening is discussed in Section 13.6.1.\nMethod Conditions #  Higher column temperatures (up to 110^0^C) are often used to reduce carryover, while the column temperature could be lower for small protein and peptide separation.\nIn addition to commonly used acidic mobile phases, alkaline buffers have been used to separate small proteins and peptides due to the unique selectivity at high pHs. However, columns packed with bonded phases to hybrid particles designed to tolerate high-pH mobile phases, such as bridged ethylene hybrid (BEH) columns or other similar columns, must be used (see Section 3.5.2).\nRecently, superficially porous particles (SPPs) have been developed for RPC applications. These particles consist of a solid core, which is impervious to the solutes, and a porous outer layer, which provides shorter diffusion pathways in the particle, thus yielding significantly higher column efficiency (20–40%) vs. those packed with totally porous particles (see Section 3.5.7). SPP columns can have lower backpressures than other particle types – a reason for the popularity of small-particle SPP (\u0026lt;3 μm) [57].\nPurolite reversed-phase chromatography #  Reversed-phase chromatography uses a polar (aqueous) mobile phase where hydrophobic molecules will adsorb to the hydrophobic stationary phase, and hydrophilic molecules will pass through uninterrupted. Hydrophobic molecules are eluted from the resin by decreasing the polarity of the mobile phase via use of non-polar solvent such as alcohol, which reduces hydrophobic interactions.\nThe more hydrophobic the molecule, the higher the concentration of solvent needed to elute the molecule.\nReverse Phase Chromatography is a frequently used analytical method to quantify and separate various molecules such as betalactam antibiotics, flavors, polyphenols, vitamins, peptides, oligonucleotides and many more. Some applications where additional separations are needed such as ion exchange in a mixed mode type of separation (such as a reverse phase chromatography resin with ion exchange capabilities). Purolite offer such resin for the separations of peptides and oligonucleotides such as 10AD2S (cation exchanger) and 10AD2Q (anion exchanger).\n source\n"},{"id":188,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-01-Theory/04_Peak_shape_measurement/","title":"Chapter 04 Peak Shape Measurement","section":"Part I Theory","content":"Chromatogram Peak.\nHow is peak shape measured? #  The tailing factor is determined by drawing a perpendicular line from the peak centre to the baseline of the peak. Then the peak width and the front half-width are measured for the peak at 5% of the height of the peak. The tailing factor is simply the entire peak width divided by twice the front half-width.\nThe non-pharmaceutical world tends to use the asymmetry factor instead of the tailing factor to measure peak tailing. The asymmetry factor is based on the front and back half-widths of the peak, but these are measured at 10% of the peak height.

For this reason, we recommend that all plumbing changes be recorded in the instrument maintenance log. It is easier then to pinpoint the most recent changes. An example of an instrument maintenance log is shown in Appendix C of this guide.\nThe internal diameter of tubing used in a HPLC system varies with the position in the instrument. Refer to your system maintenance manuals to determine the recommended tubing for a specific application.\nNote: Most suppliers of HPLC tubing now color code their products for ease of internal diameter identification.\nThe type of tubing used is determined by the application that is being performed. The two most common types of tubing are stainless steel and PEEK™, although others are also available. When changing tubing, make sure that the replacement is manufactured from a material that is compatible with any solvents that may be flushed through it.\nThermo Guide #  Cutting tubing #  Stainless Steel #  Stainless steel can be effectively cut using the procedure outlined below:\n  Estimate the length required. Remember to allow extra length if the tubing is to go around corners as sharp bends in the tubing will distort the inside bore and hence the solvent flow through it.\n  Using a stainless steel cutter, score cleanly round the tubing. If a cutter is unavailable, use a knife-file to score the tubing. Care should be taken, whichever method is used, not to distort or damage the tubing.\n  Using two pairs of smooth jawed pliers, one above the score and one below it, gently bend the tubing back and forth until it snaps. Excessive bending should be avoided as this will damage the tubing and not give a clean break.\n  There will be one or two burrs present on the cut surface. These can be carefully filed away to give a smooth, flat cut surface. Care should be taken not to allow any filed material to block the tubing bore.\n  PEEK or Polymeric Tubing #  The simplest way to cut polymeric tubing is using a blade, for example a razor blade or craft knife. The polymeric tubing cutters that are supplied by many manufacturers are essentially a razor blade in a safety housing. The advantage of using one of these cutters is that they hold the tubing at 90° to the blade so a clean, flat cut is assured.\nPolymeric tubing can be effectively cut using the procedure outlined below:\n  Estimate the length required. Remember to allow extra length if the tubing is to go around corners as sharp bends in the tubing will distort the inside bore and hence the solvent flow through it.\n  Use a sharp blade or specialist cutter to cut the tubing. Do not use a “sawing” action. This will give an uneven cut surface. Make the cut in a single action.\n  Inspect the cut surface for burrs. These can be carefully filed away to give a smooth, flat cut surface. Care should be taken not to allow any filed material to block the tubing bore.\n  As a final action, after cutting the tubing and before connecting it to the HPLC, flush it with solvent to remove any filed material, dust or other debris that could be in the tubing bore. The tubing is now ready to have fittings attached to it.\nFittings #  Fittings are available in stainless steel and a range of polymeric compounds. In general, you should use stainless steel fittings with stainless steel tubing, PEEK fittings with PEEK tubing etc.\nWe recommend that compression fittings and ferrules from different manufacturers are never interchanged. The dimensions of the fitting and ferrule vary between suppliers, so mixing them often leads to leaks, stripped threads and damage to female ports such as column inlet and outlets, detector inlets etc.\nThe amount of tubing that extends past the ferrule also varies with manufacturer. If the tubing does not seat properly within the female fitting, then leaks and increases in dead volume will occur.\nLaboratories that contain instruments from more than one manufacturer often find it useful to purchase “universal” fittings. These fittings are compatible with all instruments.\nFigure 1: Anatomy of a compression-style connection of a connecting capillary to a valve port, column endfitting, pump outlet, or detector inlet: (a) stem too long, (b) stem too short, (c) properly fitted tubing.\rCredit: Optimizing HPLC and UHPLC Performance with Agilent A-line Quick Connect Fittings\nNote: Care should always be taken when tightening fittings. Over-tightening can cause damage to the fitting threads, ferrules etc, causing the unit to leak, or in worse case scenarios, causing the fitting to break off in the housing.\nThe use of fingertight fittings is recommended wherever possible. These require no additional tools to form a leak-proof seal.\nFigure 2: Fittings\rFigure 3: Thermo Scientific SLIPFREE fittings\rBlock tubing #  Blocked tubing can either be replaced or the blockage removed. If no replacement tubing is readily available, the blockage can be done in the following way:\n  Isolate the blockage, as described in section 3.2.1 of this guide.\n  Remove the piece of tubing from the instrument, reverse it and attach the reversed end directly to a pump.\n  Flush the tubing at approximately 0.5 mL/min with a suitable solvent to remove the blockage. If the material blocking the tubing is not known, use a 50% aqueous methanol solution.\n  There are occasions when this flush procedure will not remove the blockage, for example if it is due to a large insoluble piece of seal etc. In such circumstances, increase the flow rate to between 3 and 5 mL/min to force the blockage out. This flush should be used as a last resort because of the risk of formation of solvent aerosols as the tubing unblocks. If this flush is used, ensure that the waste end of the tubing is placed in a covered beaker or sealed waste bottle for safety.\n  If the tubing remains blocks after flushing, then it must be replaced.\n  Old and Leaking Fittings #  Compression and finger tight fittings have a finite lifetime. Eventually, they will have to be replaced with new ones. The ferrule of the worn fitting will be swaged to the tubing; i.e. it will be irremovable (stainless steel) or will be removable but will leave an indentation around the tubing (PEEK). This section of tubing cannot be used again as it would not seal properly and would leak.\nTo change a fitting, follow the guideline below:\nCompression Fitting\n  Turn off all pumps – solvent should not be flowing through the system.\n  Remove the fitting from it’s housing.\n  Cut the tubing between the ferrule and fitting. If this is not possible, cut the tubing before the fitting.\n  Ensure the tubing’s cut end is flat and burr free. Inspect the old fitting; if it is worn, replace it. If it is not worn, it can be re-used with a new compatible ferrule. Note: Leaking fittings are often caused by damaged, mis-shapen ferrules, so it is not necessary to replace the whole fitting if only a part of it is damaged.\n  Assemble the new fitting and ferrule on the tubing and tighten into it’s housing to swage the ferrule onto the tubing. If the fitting still leaks after this, replace the tubing.\n  Fingertight Fitting\n Turn off all pumps – solvent should not be flowing through the system. Remove the fitting from it’s housing. Slip the fitting and ferrule (if it has a separate one) from the tubing. Inspect the tubing for defects. Remove the end of the tubing if necessary. Place the new fitting on the tubing and tighten it into it’s housing. If the fitting still leaks after this, replace the tubing.  SLIPFREE Fitting\n Turn off all pumps – solvent should not be flowing through the system. Remove the fitting from it’s housing. Check the ferrule for damage – this is the most likely cause of leaks. The SLIPFREE ferrules do not swage onto the unit’s tubing, unlike other ferrules, so they can easily be replaced. Replace the ferrule and reassemble the SLIPFREE connector into it’s housing. If the fitting still leaks, replace the entire SLIPFREE unit.  Important: There are occasions where the fitting or ferrule is not the cause of solvent leaks. They can be generated by degeneration of the fitting housing. Where persistent leaks occur, even after fitting changes, it is worth while inspecting the housing for damaged threads, blockage etc.\nChemical Compatibility of Polymeric Tubing with Solvents #  Figure 4: Solvent Compatibility with Polymeric Tubing\rNote: 1 = Compatible, no adverse effect. 2 = Application dependant.\n3 = Not compatible/recommended.

Stoll Guide Combined with an Agilent Webinar and a Thermo Poster #  Reviewing the Basics #  What follows is a short list of the characteristics of an ideal connection between components of an LC system:\n Leak-free (today, up to 20,000 psi, or more) No unswept volumes (also referred to as voids or dead volumes) No distortion of connected parts The connection can be broken and remade (that is, disconnected and reconnected) many times without changes in performance Inexpensive components  As with most things in chromatography we end up making compromises, and so it is too with fittings and connections in LC that we cannot have everything we want. I think the adage \u0026ldquo;you get what you pay for\u0026rdquo; mostly applies here in the sense that we have to pay more for fittings that consistently provide good performance and convenience. Figure 6 shows the anatomy of a typical connection in an LC system. This connection could be between a valve port or column endfitting and a connecting capillary, for example. The vast majority of consumables on the market for this purpose rely on the formation of a seal between the cone-shaped ferrule and the cone-shaped part of the receiving port. The nut drives this ferrule into the port, making leak-tight contact between the two surfaces (metal–metal, metal–polymer, or polymer–polymer). At the same time, the compression of the cone on the ferrule occurs with enough force that the ferrule effectively becomes locked into place, especially for metal ferrules.\nFigure 6: Anatomy of a compression-style connection of a connecting capillary to a valve port, column endfitting, pump outlet, or detector inlet: (a) stem too long, (b) stem too short, (c) properly fitted tubing.\rCredit: Optimizing HPLC and UHPLC Performance with Agilent A-line Quick Connect Fittings\nFigures 6a and 6b show the two most common ways that this connection process can go wrong. In the first case, if anything prevents the ferrule from moving fully into the receiving port, there is insufficient contact between the ferrule and the port surface, and the connection will leak, anywhere from a little to a lot. This situation most commonly results from using a connecting capillary that has the ferrule preswaged (that is, locked into place as a result of a connection made previously with a different receiving port) to a port depth that is different from the port depth involved in the current connection.\nFigure 7 shows that port depths vary by manufacturer, with differences ranging from zero to several millimeters. In the second case (Figure 6b) the ferrule is positioned too close to the end of the capillary, this time resulting in an unwanted void volume in the port. This incorrect positioning and added void volume can result again from moving a capillary with a preswaged ferrule from one port to another, or even from breaking and remaking a connection to the same port. The unwanted additional volume inevitably causes broadening of peaks observed at the detector; whether or not it results in a measurable increase in peak width or change in peak shape will depend on a number of factors including the size of the void, the inherent performance of the column (that is, how narrow the peaks are in volume units), and conditions of the experiment. This effect usually appears as additional peak tailing, and will be most pronounced for early-eluted peaks.\nFigure 7: Ferrule shapes and port depths associated with connections to parts from different manufacturers\rCredit: Optimizing HPLC and UHPLC Performance with Agilent A-line Quick Connect Fittings\nFigure 8 shows an example of this effect, where a very long tail was observed in the case when a small void was deliberately introduced in the column connection by using an improperly positioned ferrule. The type of tailing observed in this instance can be very problematic in cases where a small peak of interest is eluted in the tail of a much larger neighboring peak, and the chromatographic resolution is compromised because of the bad connection. Below is an instruction video on Youtube.\nFigure 8: Comparison of chromatograms obtained with good column connections (blue) and connections with a small void introduced deliberately (red)\rCredit: Optimizing HPLC and UHPLC Performance with Agilent A-line Quick Connect Fittings\n\rSome Things Stay the Same, But . . . #  The basic principles associated with good connections in LC have not changed since the days of the early high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems. Indeed, the images shown in Figures 6 and 7 are very similar to the ones used by John Dolan and his coauthors in the early \u0026ldquo;LC Troubleshooting\u0026rdquo; columns he wrote in the 1980s on this topic$^{1,2}$. However, I\u0026rsquo;d like to comment specifically here on three aspects that have changed quite a bit since then.\nCutting Your Own Tubing #  In his 1984 article (1), Dolan encouraged purchasing precut tubing, but gave advice for making good cuts in the case when you need to cut your own tubing. There was a time when I cut my own metal tubing too, but in hindsight those capillaries were awful. Given the relatively low cost of precut metal tubing today, and the potential for serious peak dispersion that could be introduced by a bad cut, it is hard to imagine justifying cutting our own tubing now. Plastic tubing, typically made of PEEK for high-pressure connections up to about 5000 psi, is a different story, however. In this case, it is relatively easy to make a good, clean, and square cut using a cutter designed for this purpose, which is available from most consumable vendors. In my laboratory, we use a lot of PEEK tubing, especially in situations where we are experimenting with different instrument configurations. After we settle on a configuration we like, then we will change all of the connections to metal capillaries because we find them to be the most reliable over time.\nInterchangeability of Fittings and Multiple Connections #  In a 1988 article (2), Dolan argued that the specific ferrule type did not matter much, as long as the tubing stem depth (see Figure #) is matched to the receiving port, because the shape of the ferrule conforms to the shape of the port anyway. However, I think the bigger issue in practice is that this idea of interchangeability can quickly lead one to believe that a capillary with a swaged fitting can be moved from one port to another (for example, from a valve to a column, or from one column to another) without any problems. Today, I think moving these capillaries with preswaged fittings around is just asking for trouble. Disconnecting a capillary from a valve port and reconnecting it to the same port may work for a few times, but eventually this practice will lead to small leaks, and so it must be monitored carefully. Given the demands of modern columns for good connections to realize the full performance potential of the column, moving a preswaged capillary from one column to the next is more likely to be problematic than not. A systematic study of this issue by Stankovich, Guiochon, and coworkers clearly showed how serious this problem can be $^3$. They found that reusing the same preswaged fitting to connect to columns from three different manufacturers with similar endfitting designs introduced extra peak dispersion up to 7 µL$^3$! Considering that this level of band spreading happens in the column itself in some cases, this problem with the fitting could lead to efficiency losses on the order of 50% or more. The most effective way to avoid these problems is to simply use a new capillary when making a new connection, so that the ferrule is freshly swaged and adapted to the particular receiving port involved. Of course, this approach can become expensive when making many changes to a system. In my laboratory, we carefully check for leaks when remaking connections to valves and pumps using preswaged fittings. When connecting to columns, we never use the swaged fittings shown in Figure 7; instead, we use the newer types of fittings (discussed in detail below) that are designed to be reused while making good connections each time.\nFingertight Fittings #  So-called fingertight fittings are very attractive to LC practitioners simply because it is convenient to quickly make a new connection to a column or other instrument component without wrenches. Many consumables vendors advertise fingertight fittings that are leak tight up to pressures on the order of 20,000 psi without wrenches. In my laboratory, we find that some of the newer two-piece fingertight fitting designs are an improvement over older one-piece designs and are reliable up to about 10,000 psi without wrenches. Again, with this convenience comes increased costs. For very high-pressure operations up to 20,000 psi, we still find that connections are done most reliably by completing them with wrenches.\nRecent Trends in Connection Technology #  Two decades ago when the norm in column technology involved 5-µm particles in 150 mm × 4.6 mm columns, the column itself contributed a lot of the band spreading apparent in an observed peak, and thus the separations were relatively forgiving with respect to connections made between the components of the LC system. As column technology has improved, however, manufacturers have recognized the need to make good connections reliably, at high pressure, and repeatedly with the same capillary and endfitting. Two completely different endfitting designs that have been introduced relatively recently to address this need: the Quick Connect fitting (Agilent Technologies) and the Viper fitting (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In the first case, the fitting has an internal spring-based mechanism that ensures that the capillary stem is forced to the bottom of the receiving port as the fitting is tightened. This mechanism increases the likelihood of making a good connection every time by avoiding the type of void shown in Figure 1b. The fitting\u0026rsquo;s polymer-based ferrule also conforms to slight changes in receiving port shape, allowing for reuse of the fitting many times without leaks.\nFigure 9: Agilent A-Line Quick Connect fittings\rFigure 10: Thermo Viper\rThe chromatograms shown in Figure 11 show that this new design can provide the same high-quality connection to the column that we expect from the swaged metal ferrule design, as we do not observe the severe peak tailing resulting from a bad connection as shown in Figure 3. Furthermore, the chromatograms show that this high-quality connection can be made many times over using the same fitting without any performance losses.\nFigure 11: Comparison of chromatograms obtained with a freshly swaged stainless steel fitting and the Quick Connect fitting before and after multiple connections\rFinally, Figure 13 shows the design of a fitting based on an approach that is completely different from the cone-shaped ferrules that have been used historically. In this case, the seal between the capillary and the receiving port is made at the very bottom of the port, increasing the likelihood that a void-free connection will be made. As with the previous design, the sealing component is polymeric, which enables the reuse of the fitting many times without performance losses. Here again these performance advantages and conveniences come at the cost of the price of the consumable part.\nFigure 12: Conventional fitting systems often create extracolumn volumes caused by incorrect positioning of the ferrule or by slipping of the capillary when subjected to high pressures. The chromatogram demonstrates deteriorated peak shape caused by a slipped capillary at a backpressure of only 600 bar (8,700 psi)\rCredit: Ensuring Best Possible UHPLC Performance Through an Innovative Capillary and Fitting Design\nFigure 13: The Viper fingertight fitting system does not use a ferrule and eliminates any extracolumn volumes by design. The chromatogram overlay shows consistent peak shapes under identical conditions as in Figure 11\rCredit: Ensuring Best Possible UHPLC Performance Through an Innovative Capillary and Fitting Design\nSummary #  LC practitioners are faced with an overwhelming number of choices for fittings that can be used to connect the components of LC systems. Users must ultimately decide which fitting technology offers the best compromise of performance and cost for each particular situation. For dedicated LC systems where system reconfiguration is infrequent-and especially for connections between instrument components excluding the column- traditional metal, ferrule-based fittings usually offer the best compromise of cost, reliability, and quality of connections. For connections to columns, particularly when changing columns frequently, reusable fittings that do not involve swaging of a metal ferrule to the capillary are very convenient. Technologies introduced by several manufacturers over the past few years have improved the design of these reusable fittings, and now enable repeated connections of high quality and at very high pressures using a single fitting. These technologies come at increased costs, but the performance gains and ease of use they provide will outweigh the costs in many practical situations.\n  J.W. Dolan and V.N.

Majors\nLCGC North America\nLCGC North America, LCGC North America-11-01-2007, Volume 25, Issue 11\nPages: 1074–1092\nIn this installment of \u0026ldquo;Column Watch,\u0026rdquo; columnist Ron Majors examines the role of pressure in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from two viewpoints: (1)the impact of the ultrahigh pressures encountered in ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) on chromatographic parameters and (2)increases in column pressure encountered in normal daily use. The latter is of more practical consequence to HPLC users since increased back pressure usually implies that something has gone wrong with the column. Pressure increases due to physical and chemical contamination are explored and practical approaches to solve these problems are suggested.\nWhen considering the resolution equation in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we think of efficiency, selectivity, and retention factors but there is no obvious, direct mention of pressure. Yet pressure is one of the most important parameters in successful HPLC. The role of pressure is to drive the mobile phase through the small particles packed into the chromatographic column. To do this, we must employ a high-pressure pump that can provide sufficient hydraulic pressure to overcome the resistance of the packed bed. Until recently, the upper pressure limit was not a major discussion point because pumps that provided up to 400 bar were freely available. Only when the column, which normally operated well below the upper pressure limit of the pump, started to give an abnormally high back pressure near this upper limit, did chromatographers get concerned about pressure. In this installment of \u0026ldquo;Column Watch,\u0026rdquo; I will cover two aspects of dealing with the pressure experienced by HPLC columns. (1)One consideration will be a discussion of the pressure generated by going to smaller particles, a current trend in analytical HPLC. (2)The second consideration, and perhaps more important to the average user, will be pressure changes dictated by changes in the column itself. It is the latter issue that concerns many chromatographers because increased column back pressure usually implies that something has gone wrong with the column. In some cases, the column can be dead and will have to be replaced. In other cases, the column might be salvageable. I will look at some of these issues and provide some solutions to handle this type of back pressure problem.\nColumn Back Pressure Equation\nJust to make sure that there is an understanding of pressure terms, Table I provides some of the terms that are used in HPLC. The most commonly accepted unit of pressure in recent years has been bar, but psi, atm, and kPa are thrown around. These interchangeable terms sometimes have caused confusion.\nNow, let us look at the equation (equation 1) that governs back pressure in a packed bed.\nFigure : \rPressure is directly proportional to viscosity (η), column length (L), and flow rate (F). In practice, the viscosity of a fluid usually manifests itself as a resistance to flow. So if a high-viscosity liquid is used as the HPLC mobile phase, a higher pressure will be observed. Thus, when a chromatographer is choosing a mobile phase component, the lowest viscosity mobile phase should be chosen. For example, in reversed-phase HPLC, if one has a choice for the organic portion of the mobile phase, then acetonitrile would be chosen over isopropanol due to its lower viscosity. Of course, there are other considerations in choosing the organic solvent such as solvent strength, polarity, analyte solubility, analyte compatibility, and so on.\nfigure image Table I: Pressure terms used in HPLC\nColumn length is an obvious factor in back pressure. A longer column will require considerably more force to move a liquid through the packed bed. Sometimes, chromatographers must resort to increasing the column length to achieve a better separation. If the column becomes too long, then the pressure might exceed the capability of the pump and other adjustments to the operating conditions must be made. For example, the third component of the numerator in equation 1 is F. Often, when the chromatographer desires to speed up the separation, increasing the flow rate is a simple parameter to adjust. However, too high of a flow rate can result in overpressuring the pump, so there is a compromise. If the pressure becomes too high, then reducing the flow rate is an alternative to keep the operating pressure below the upper limit of the pump. As in all aspects of chromatography, there must be a balance of these operating parameters.\nIn equation 1, the biggest factor that influences pressure is the packing particle diameter dp. The particle diameter has a big impact because pressure is inversely proportional to dp2. Decreasing the particle size by half increases the pressure by a factor of 4. Thus, if one were operating a column at a pressure of 125 bar, and if all other chromatographic parameters stayed the same, the pressure would increase to 500 bar, which exceeds the operating pressure of all but the newest generation of HPLC pumps. Fortunately, when the particle diameter of the packing inside the column is decreased, one can shorten L without sacrificing much resolution. By shortening the column length, the pressure does not increase as much. Recently, there has been a movement to decrease the particle diameter of commercial columns to below 2-μm and pump pressures of older generation pumps might be limited, especially for columns 100–150 mm in length.\nHigher column back pressures have been encountered because of the increased use of sub-2-μm particles, resulting in back pressures that are higher than previously experienced. Thus, the use of temperature to lower solvent viscosity has become fashionable. With an increase in temperature, column back pressure decreases due to a decrease in η. In addition, efficiency increases due to more rapid solute mass transfer and retention decreases as solutes favor the mobile phase. Selectivity (relative retention) also can be affected with changes in temperature.\nAs long as the column maintains a steady back pressure, there is generally no need for concern. Of course, when a gradient is performed, it is common for the back pressure to change because of viscosity changes of the mobile phase as solvents are mixed during gradient elution. When the column begins to experience significantly increasing back pressure, that is a bad sign. We will explore this aspect further later in this installment.\nThe Effect of High Pressure on Chromatographic Parameters\nWith the increase in chromatographic pressure, there has been a closer look taken at how these pressures will impact the chromatographic experiment. Although there have been many studies over the years employing high pressures in liquid chromatography (1–15), only recently has commercial instrumentation been made available that can make use of small particles and their greater efficiency gains. Pumping systems are now available commercially that can achieve up to 20,000 psi (1380 bar). Commercial columns packed with particles down to 1.5-μm are also available. Some of these sub-2-μm packed columns are available in lengths up to 150 mm. To illustrate the impact of these smaller packings when packed into longer columns, Table II, taken from reference 14, compares the expected performance and pressure requirements of 25-cm-long columns, packed with particles ranging from 0.75 to 5 μm in size, operated at the optimum flow velocity for a small organic analyte. Reducing the particle diameter from 5 μm to 1 μm yields a fivefold increase in theoretical plates and a fivefold decrease in analysis time. However, the pressure requirements increase 125-fold. To take full advantage of the performance of small particles, these pressure limitations must be overcome.\nfigure image Table II: Pressure requirements and performance expected for differing stationary phase particle diameters in a 25-cm long column. Values calculated for an analyte with k = 2, DM = 6.0 Ã 10â6 cm2/s, and a mobile phase viscosity (Î·) = 1.0 cP. (taken from reference 14)\nThe most intensive studies on high-pressure HPLC have been performed in the laboratories of Jorgensen (3,5,7,8,14), Lee (4,6,13,15), and Colon (11). Jorgensen used the term ultrahigh-pressure LC (UHPLC) to describe pressures in excess of the commonly used pressures at the time of the publication. This term seems to have stuck for work being performed with sub-2-μm packed columns.\nIn 2005, Martin and Guiochon (16) published a more rigorous study that addressed some of the issues raised by Jorgensen in his UHPLC papers, such as a change in the retention factor with pressure increases. In commonly used chromatographic conditions of several hundred bar, many of the normal chromatographic parameters are affected very little. However, when the conditions wander into the 1000+ bar range, high pressure induces changes in the physical-chemical properties of solvents, solutes, and column packings. For solutes, molar volume, solubility, and diffusion coefficients change. For solvents, the melting point increases, and density and viscosity increase. For the column, geometric deformation of the bed and column tube occurs. As pointed out earlier (14), high pressure gives rise to significant viscous heating inside the column, which can give rise to changes in radial and axial velocity profiles that can result in band broadening, the temperature change can shift k values, and local changes in viscosity, density, and other parameter can occur. The generated heat (power), equal to the product of the flow rate times the pressure, can cause significant temperature gains that increase with ΔP2 for a thermostated column and even more strongly in an insulated or poorly temperature-controlled environment (17). Jorgensen (3) showed several watts of power dissipation can occur in a conventional HPLC column, necessitating the use of smaller internal diameter columns that dissipate the heat more effectively in UHPLC. The reader is referred to the previous references in order to gain a more thorough understanding of the effects of ultrahigh pressure on the chromatography.\nWhat Causes Column Pressure Changes?\nMechanical causes of pressure changes: Basically, to diagnose pressure problems, it pays to take a look at the basic construction on an HPLC column. Figure 1 shows a typical HPLC stainless steel column configuration. A typical analytical column has an outer diameter compatible with compression fittings (¼ in.) and an inner diameter of 4.6 mm. The column usually consists of a stainless steel tube (although other materials such as PEEK or glass are used). The packing is contained in this tube and is held in place by endfittings at either end. The endfittings used in HPLC columns are most frequently compression fittings containing a ferrule and a frit. The endfittings must withstand the packing and operating pressure of the column.\nfigure image Figure 1: Schematic of a typical analytical HPLC column.\nAn important element in the endfitting is the frit. One has an inlet frit at the top and an outlet frit at the bottom. Sometimes the frit is pressed into the column rather than the endfitting. The frit has a diameter that must match the column tubing outside diameter. It must be thick enough to have good mechanical strength, yet thin enough to ensure mobile phase and sample permeability. The porosity of the frit is how much \u0026ldquo;empty space\u0026rdquo; is in the frit. It must not have too much porosity so that it is not mechanically stable or too little porosity so it becomes a restriction. Finally, just like the packing material being held, there is a pore diameter that is the average diameter of the openings in the frit surface.\nThe job of the outlet frit is to contain the packing material. During the slurry packing process for an HPLC packing material, this frit and the column packing suspended in the slurry are subject to very high pressure. The porosity and mechanical strength of the outlet frit are critical to contain the on-rush of slurry during the packing process. Packing pressure higher than the normal operating pressure is essential to form a tight bed. Packing particles must withstand the high packing velocity that occurs during the packing process. If the particles are not mechanically strong, they can be fractured, resulting in fines and potential plugging problems down the line. If particle breakage occurs, the column will show an abnormally high back pressure after it is packed when it is tested. Most manufacturers have pressure specifications and will reject a column that displays abnormally high pressure after packing. However, there can be cases in which particles are fractionated within the packed bed during use. An example of the latter case might be when using a high pH mobile phase on a silica gel-based column. High-pH buffers can cause dissolution of the packing and fines can be created. The fines might eventually work their way down the packed bed and lodge in the outlet frit causing plugging to occur. Remedying this situation presents a difficulty because removing the bottom fitting can disturb the packed bed and ruin the column.\nBecause column-packing particles contain a distribution rather than discrete sizes, the porosity of the frit must be sufficient to retain the lower end of the particle size distribution. Otherwise, some of the packing particles could pass through the frit. As mentioned earlier, the outlet frit itself has its own pore size distribution because the frit is constructed of sintered stainless steel particles. The pores in the frit structure are the spaces between these sintered particles and they allow liquid to pass freely but prevent packing particles from doing so. For a 5-μm particle, a typical particle size distribution of this packing might range from 3 μm to 7 μm, with 5 μm being the average. Thus, the frit\u0026rsquo;s average porosity must be smaller than the smallest particle size in the packing particle size distribution. So for the previous example, one would choose a 2-μm frit to use for the outlet, below the 3-μm particle size, the low end of the distribution. As the particle size decreases, the frit porosity must be reduced proportionally. Smaller porosity frits will retain smaller packing particles but also can be plugged easier or will show higher back pressure themselves.\nThe inlet frit also serves to contain the packing material but not to the extent of the outlet frit. The inlet frit is not subjected to the on-rush of the packing slurry because it is affixed after the column has been packed at high pressure. However, during operation, the inlet frit is exposed to incoming mobile phase and incoming liquid sample from the injector. If these incoming liquids are not entirely clean, especially with regard to dust and other particulates (for example, seal materials, stainless steel filings, buffer salts, solvent impurities, and so forth), the inlet frit is the first porous bed that is encountered and it becomes an excellent filter that prevents the particulates (larger than the pores) from entering the column and perhaps plugging the packed bed. However, the frit itself can become plugged and one sees a rise on the pressure readout.\nUsually, plugging of the inlet frit is not a catastrophic occurrence — it happens gradually until the pressure rises sufficiently to shut down the pump. Particulates build up on the inlet frit and actually can lodge within the porous matrix, preventing the free flow of mobile phase. In some cases, if salts are precipitated in the column inlet, the head pressure can rise dramatically rather quickly. Sometimes particulates entering the inlet from the tubing connecting the injector and the column build up in the center of the inlet frit and do not immediately cause a buildup of pressure. However, this buildup can only partially block the inlet frit causing a nonuniform distribution of sample and peak asymmetry.\nWhat are Sources of Particulates?\nThere are a number of sources of particulates (solids) that can plug the inlet frit. Particulates can be present in the samples being injected. During sample preparation, there are often several sample preparation techniques employed such as extraction, evaporation, precipitation, and so on. Particulates can come from dust, salt residues, filter paper, and other sources that contaminate the sample. Particulates can result from the normal wear of the injection valve rotor seal, which consists of polymeric materials such as polyimide (Vespel, DuPont, Wilmington, Delaware), ethylene–tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (Tefzel, DuPont), and PEEK. With time, these rotor seals can give off very small pieces of polymeric material that can lodge on the inlet frit. Particles in the mobile phase also can be culprits. HPLC-grade solvents purchased from reliable manufacturers usually are prefiltered at the factory and do not need further filtration. However, aqueous and organic mobile phase mixtures that one prepares in the laboratory such as buffers and solvent mixtures are subject to the introduction of particulates during the weighing, pipetting, volumetic transfer, and salt dissolution processes.\nPump seals and check valves are another source of particulates. These consumable items are subject to day-in and day-out mechanical stress and eventually wear out. The devices contain polymeric sealing materials that are subject to the same wear problems as injector rotor seals. The particulates can be small enough so as to pass through some of the HPLC system components (for example, mixers, pulse dampers, and tubing) but large enough to lodge in a porous frit at the inlet to the column.\nAn overlooked source of particulates is salt precipitates. Aqueous buffers often are used in reversed-phase, ion-exchange, and aqueous size-exclusion chromatography. Many buffer salts are insoluble in mobile phases with high organic content or 100% organic. If the aqueous–organic mobile phases are created in the gradient pumping system, at high organic levels there might be the possibility of precipitation or emulsion formation upon mixing. It is best to externally check the highest organic solvent composition added to the aqueous solution to make sure that no cloudiness occurs (indicative of salt precipitation). Such a check for precipitants also can prevent seal wear within the flow system. Also, do not forget that the sample solvent can be a source of salt precipitation. If the sample is loaded with salt and it is injected into a high-organic mobile phase, the salt in the sample can precipitate. In this case, a simple desalting procedure can be used to remove this salt. Vice versa, if the mobile phase is high in salt and a large volume of organic solvent is used for the sample injection, salt in the mobile phase can come out of solution.\nHow to Cope with Particulates and Plugged Inlet Frits\nThe best way to deal with particulates is to remove them before they reach the inlet frit. Samples and even standards should be filtered using HPLC membrane syringe filters, available from a variety of manufacturers. Clean liquid samples prevent the blocking of capillaries, frits, and the column inlet. In addition, clean samples result in less wear and tear on the critical moving parts of injection valves. Sample filters come in a number of different porosities and diameters. For use with 3.0–3.5 μm and 5.0-μm columns, a 0.45-μm porosity filter is suggested. For the newer sub-2-μm columns, a 0.20-μm porosity filter would be best because frits used on these columns are generally much smaller than those used on conventional 5-μm columns. If sample volume is limited, use the smallest possible filter diameter such as 13 or 25 mm.\nAn important consideration is the choice of membrane. Choice of membrane is dictated by injection-solvent and analyte compatibility with the polymeric material. Syringe filters made from materials such as regenerated cellulose, PTFE, nylon, cellulose nitrate, and cellulose acetate are common in the HPLC laboratory. Readers are directed to syringe-filter manufacturers' literature that often have solvent compatibility tables or to an excellent article in a previous issue of LCGC (18).\nFor mobile phases, especially self-made buffers, filtration also is recommended. Clean mobile phases reduce wear on instrument parts (for example, check valves, piston seals, and autosamplers). Again, make sure that the filter membrane used is compatible with the mobile phase solvent being filtered. Simple vacuum filtration flask systems are available commercially. An added benefit is that in vacuum filtration, the mobile phase is degassed also but most modern HPLC systems have in-line degassing as a standard feature. Mobile phase filters also can be placed in the solvent reservoir. It is attached to the end of the reservoir tube between it and the pump inlet. Mobile phase reservoir filters generally have rather large porosities (greater than 2 μm) because they cannot provide a restriction to the pump inlet. Otherwise, cavitation can occur.\nA popular approach to ensure clean samples or mobile phases is to install an in-line filter (see Figure 2). These days, in-line filters have minimal dead volume, so they provide minimal contribution to band broadening. The filter can be inserted between the injector and the analytical column (column prefilter) or between the pump and the injector. When placed between the injector and the column, the filter protects the column from mobile phase as well as sample particulates. When placed between the pump and the injector, the filter protects against mobile phase particulates only. Some in-line filters have replaceable filter elements and are finger-tightened. For samples that are sensitive to stainless steel, metal-free in-line filters are available. In-line filters must be able to hold up to the column operating pressure because they are installed on the high-pressure side of the pump.\nfigure image Figure 2: Schematic of an LC system showing in-line devices used to prevent back-pressure problems.\nAnother particulate removal technique is the use of a guard column (see Figure 2). Normally, a guard column is recommended to prevent chemical not mechanical contamination of the analytical column (see the following). It is placed between the injector and the HPLC column. A guard column is a shorter version of the analytical column and normally should be packed with the same packing material. Because the guard column frequently is constructed in a similar manner to the analytical column, it is the first system component that particulates might meet (if no in-line filter is installed). Thus, it would become plugged before the analytical column is plugged. Because the cost of the guard column is a fraction of the analytical column, it is generally discarded and replaced when its pressure rises or it becomes contaminated.\nOnce the inlet filter becomes blocked and the column pressure rises unacceptably, there are a couple of approaches that can be tried to rectify the situation. The most popular approach is to backflush the column by removing it from the chromatograph and attaching the inlet line from the injector to the column exit. The idea here is to dislodge accumulated particulates by flushing them out of the inlet frit. Do not connect the column to the detector during backflushing to prevent accumulated particles from being flushed into the detector flow cell and perhaps causing problems there. The column outlet (formerly the inlet!) should be directed to waste. The initial flow rate should be lower than the normally used flow rate but can be increased as the particulates are removed. Sometimes, this procedure does not do the trick because the particulates have become embedded within the porous elements of the frit.\nOne word of caution: make sure that the inlet frit\u0026rsquo;s porosity is lower than the particle size distribution of the packing in the column (as discussed earlier). Some manufacturers use a higher porosity frit (2- or 5-μm porosity) at the inlet to the column to prevent early plugging. If such a column is backflushed, there is a chance of also flushing out some of the packing particles during the process. Check the column instruction or data sheet or call the manufacturer to make sure that their columns can be backflushed. If the column has an arrow on its side, this sign might be indicative of a column not to be backflushed. In general, any well-packed column should be operable of flow in either direction.\nA second approach to solving a plugged inlet frit is to replace the endfitting. In general, I would not recommend doing this because the packing material that is in contact with the frit will almost always be disrupted because it sticks to the frit (inlet fitting) that is removed. Replacing this disrupted (removed) packing material with some additional packing will not provide a homogeneous bed, and column efficiency will be impaired. Instead, if the backflushing cannot be accomplished or is not successful, it is probably best to discard the column.\nOne other possibility of an increase in column pressure is a blocked flow line in the system between the pump outlet and the head of the column. A blocked line could result from a particulate lodging in the tiny internal diameter tubing that is now being used to decrease system dead volume required for the newer, high-efficiency columns. A systematic removal of system components from the column backwards through the connecting line from the injector, any in-line filters or guard columns, the injector itself, and prior system components should eventually find the blocked element. Obviously, if the analytical column is removed from the system and the pressure readout is still high, the column is not the culprit so work backwards accordingly. Be careful when performing this systematic removal at high pressure just in case a blockage is quickly dislodged because solvent can be sprayed from the component.\nChemical Causes of Pressure Buildup\nSo far, I have covered mechanical reasons (for example, particulates or blockages) why column pressure can increase. An equally strong possibility is pressure buildup caused by chemical contamination of the packed bed. Just like mechanical contaminants, chemical contaminants can arise from a variety of sources — samples, sample matrices, mobile phases, or system components. The most likely source of chemical contamination is from the sample, especially if insufficient or no sample preparation has been used to treat a complex sample.\nUsually there are compounds in the sample matrix that are of no interest to the analyst but are present nevertheless. High molecular weight compounds, salts, lipids, waxes and fatty compounds, humic acids, hydrophobic proteins, and other biological compounds are but a few of the myriad possible substances that can come in contact with an HPLC column during its use. These materials can have lesser or greater retention than the analytes of interest. Those that have lesser retention such as salts usually will be eluted from the column at the void volume. These undesired interferences might or might not be observed with the detector being used and, if detected, show up as chromatographic peaks, blobs, baseline upsets, sometimes even as negative peaks. If sample matrix components are retained strongly on the column and if the mobile phase solvent composition itself never becomes strong enough to elute them, over the course of many injections, these adsorbed or absorbed compounds will accumulate, usually at the head of the column. Such behavior is observed more often when isocratic conditions are used. Sample compounds that are of intermediate retention can be eluted slowly and show up as wide peaks, baseline disturbances, or as baseline drift. With gradient conditions, because the column is subjected to a stronger mobile phase during the run, sometimes these contaminants are removed in the latter stages of the gradient run.\nOn occasion, the sorbed sample (or mobile phase) components build up to such high levels they can begin to act like a new stationary phase. Analytes can interact with these impurities that now contribute to the separation mechanism. Retention times might shift, and tailing can occur. If sufficient contamination occurs, the column back pressure can build up to intolerably high levels, overpressuring the pump and perhaps causing the column to settle and void, depending upon where the blockage occurs.\nIt is this latter case that I will explore in this section. Noneluted sample components usually build up on the HPLC inlet column packing and, if unchecked, can cause these pressure buildups. The best way to remove chemical contaminants is to flush the column with a solvent that will dissolve the contaminants, yet will not harm the column packing itself. For example, precipitated proteins often are removed from a polymeric column by flushing the column with strong base, perhaps of pH 13 or 14. However, a silica gel-based column would most likely be harmed in this process, unless the column is a special reversed-phase column designed for high pH.\nThe best way to clean a column is to backflush (not forward flush) the column with a solvent or series of solvents that will remove the contaminants causing the pressure buildup. Note that forward flushing is not recommended because sparingly soluble substances can take a long time to flush the entire length of the column and can become spread out during the process. Instead, in the reversed configuration, the pathlength from the inlet \u0026ldquo;chemical plug\u0026rdquo; to the column exit is much shorter and the washing time greatly reduced.\nSeveral years ago, I wrote an article on the cleaning and regeneration of reversed-phase HPLC columns (19). In this column, I discussed approaching for washing silica-and polymeric-based reversed-phase columns to remove protein and other residues. In addition, special techniques for cleaning reversed-phase columns when simple solvent washing does not work were covered. Rather than repeating the contents of the article here, I refer the reader to the original publication. Just remember, before washing any column used with a salt buffer, first remove the salt by flushing with a salt-free mobile phase of equivalent composition. A similar article on the regeneration of biopolymer columns was published many years ago but is still applicable today (20).\nFor normal-phase columns such as silica gel, cyano, or diol, a similar procedure can be used in which progressively stronger solvents are used to wash contaminants from the column. For these columns, we have found that washing the column with 20 column volumes (a 250 mm × 4.6 mm column has a column volume of about 2.5 mL) of a 50:50 mixture of hexane–chloroform followed by methanol, methylene chloride, or 100% ethyl acetate seems to do a good job. Isopropanol also can be used; it seems to have good solubility properties for fatty compounds. Be careful not to run too high of a flow rate during the washing experiments, as isopropanol\u0026rsquo;s viscosity is quite high.\nMicrobial growth often occurs in buffers and aqueous mobile phases, especially if they are permitted to stand around for long periods of time at room temperature. Particulates or the bacteria from microbial growth can plug the column inlet or lodge on the column packing itself.\nAnother overlooked source of chemical contamination is the use of the wrong rotor material in the injection valve for noncompatible solvents or pH. For example, Vespel, a frequently used polymeric material in rotary injector valves, is not compatible with high-pH buffers. Prolonged use of such a valve under basic conditions will result in increased wear and earlier failure. Instead, in this case, a Tefzel valve core material is more compatible. Consult with the valve or instrument manufacturer on solvent compatibility of instrument parts.\nPrevention of Chemical Buildup on HPLC Columns\nThe best way to prevent chemical contamination is to remove these undesired sample components before they reach the analytical column. Proper sample preparation procedures to remove matrix and interfering compounds are paramount to extending column life and in preventing pressure buildup. There are many procedures used for sample cleanup (21,22). For liquid chromatographers, solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid–liquid extraction are among the more popular. Through the removal of undesirable compounds, method development is also much easier, column overloading can be avoided, and chromatographic resolution can be increased.\nThe use of a guard column (Figure 2) is recommended as a safeguard to prevent chemical contamination of the analytical column. The guard column should contain packing that is the same as that used in the analytical column. Otherwise, it can affect the chromatographic separation. If, for some reason, a guard column is to be used that contains a different bonded phase, then the bonded phase should be a weaker (not a stronger) sorbent than the analytical phase it is to protect. The purpose of the guard column for this case is to adsorb (or absorb) those strongly retained components from the sample that will foul the stationary phase on the analytical column. As the contaminants build up and the pressure on the guard column rises, it is replaced. Because the guard column is much lower cost than the analytical column that it protects, it is probably not worth the time to clean this column to reclaim it, although there is no reason why this could not be done. The guard column can serve to chemical contaminants introduced by the mobile phase, although normally mobile phase components (for example, buffer salts, aqueous and organic solvents, acids, bases, additives, and so on) are selected in the purest available state.\nOne other device, shown in Figure 2, that has been used for column protection is the precolumn. This column is sometimes used to presaturate the mobile phase with dissolved silica when the mobile phase pH exceeds that recommended for the bonded silica column. Many silica-based HPLC columns have an upper pH limit of 8–9 due to dissolution of the underlying silica by the hydroxide ion. The idea of the saturator column, packed with coarse silica particles, is to condition the incoming mobile phase with dissolved silicate, retarding silica dissolution of the analytical column. Usually, a 0.2-μm in-line filter is placed just after the precolumn to exclude any dissolved particles from the injector and the column inlet. However, the added volume of a precolumn adds greatly to the gradient delay volume, adds back pressure to the system, and because of this additional pressure the analytical column pressure cannot be determined alone. For those reasons, the use of precolumns is not popular anymore. Rather, more chemically stable analytical columns should be used instead. However, sometimes precolumns are used for isocratic analysis where the additional volume is of minor consequence.\nTo prevent microbial growth, it is recommended that pure aqueous buffer be discarded at the end of the day. When preparing buffer, use only the amount required for one day\u0026rsquo;s use and place the remainder in the refrigerator. To retard microbial growth, some recommend adding 200 ppm of sodium azide to the aqueous mobile phase. However, azides are very toxic and potentially explosive. Alternatively, if one is not using 100% aqueous at the beginning of the gradient, then the addition of 10% organic to the aqueous solvent (solvent A) is sufficient to retard bacterial growth.\nColumn Pressure Decreases or Fluctuations\nUp to this point, I have discussed the normal cases in which the column pressure increases. Column pressure also can decrease or fluctuate, but these pressure changes are not associated with the packed bed or the frits. Column pressure decreases are the result of hardware problems such as pump cavitation, leaking pump check valves or piston seals, leaking injector seals or leaks somewhere in the system (for example, fittings). Usually leaks are rather obvious because liquid will be spotted around the leaking component. Pressure fluctuations are most likely due to pump cavitation or a bubble in the pump.\nConclusions\nIf this installment of \u0026ldquo;Column Watch\u0026rdquo; I have investigated pressure from two aspects: the impact of ultrahigh pressure on physiochemical parameters and pressure changes due to mechanical or chemical blockages. The former aspect was to make users aware of how pressure can impact chromatographic performance due to the recent trends of increased use of ultrahigh pressures. The latter aspect of pressure changes is more immediate for most users because it affects column life and back pressure of commonly used analytical columns. Pressure blockages from particulates can be prevented by the installation of in-line devices such as filters and guard columns or by sample and mobile phase filtration. Pressure increases due to chemical contaminates in the packing can be handled by thorough washing of the columns, use of proper sample preparation techniques, and by the use of disposable guard columns.\nRonald E.

End-capped C18 columns have the advantage of offering the highest hydrophobic retention among C18 phases, while limiting other chromatographic interactions, due to end-capping and high surface coverage.\nBut, what if your mobile phase contains a high percentage of water or your analytes are more polar? Under highly aqueous conditions, a traditional C18 column will undergo a phenomenon known as “phase dewetting”. When this occurs, the hydrophobic C18 chains repel water out of the particle pores, which limits analyte access to the stationary phase. So, in this case, an aqueous C18 column, which has about 15% carbon load, is recommended. These phases are compatible with 100% aqueous mobile phases and also provide more retention for polar molecules that need an extra boost. This extra retention comes from a polar modification of the phase that also makes it 100 % water compatible.[1]\nAnother factor to consider is pH. While low pHs can improve peak shape and the selectivity of a separation, these highly-acidic conditions can irreversibly damage your stationary phase. C18 phases with sterically protected ligands excel in low pH environments.\nThese bulky side chains protect the phase from being removed from the surface under acidic conditions, but also allows some extra polar interactions of your analytes with the silica surface for unique selectivity. These assets make them perfect candidates for multiclass and pesticide analyses.\nSo, is a C18 a C18? As you can see, there are many differences between C18 columns, and each have their own advantages. So, rather than selecting one you may be more familiar with, it’s worth taking the time to consider the needs of your analysis before making a choice.\nColumn Dimensions #  \rHPLC column dimensions are an important selection during method development as they impact the efficiency, sensitivity, and speed of your analysis. efficiency (refer to the following equation) is directly proportional to column length. This approach has its limitations as doubling column length increases resolution, but only by a factor of 1.4 while also significantly increasing back pressure.\n$ \\textrm{efficiency} ∝ \\frac{\\textrm{length}}{\\textrm{particle size}} $\nShort column lengths, such as 50 mm, will give short run times and are ideal for gradient analysis. Long column lengths, such as 250 mm, have more resolving power, but come with the cost of longer analysis time and increased back pressure. When considering your column’s inner diameter, it is important to keep your mode of detection in mind. RI, fluorescence, or UV detectors can handle much higher flow rates than LC-MS. Conventional LC-MS flow rates are in the range of 0.3-0.6 mL/min. These flow rates pair well with 2.1 mm and 3.0 mm ID columns. Additionally, as column diameter is reduced, sensitivity can be improved several fold, assuming mass on column is kept constant and your instrument is optimized for low-volume columns.\nParticles of stationary phase [2] #  \rFully porous or superficially porous? 1.8 or 2.7 µm? 90 or 300 $\\mathring{A}$? These are only a handful of the choices that are available when you are choosing your LC particle. Superficially porous particles, such as Raptor, feature a solid, impermeable core enveloped by a thin, porous layer of silica that decreases the diffusion path and reduces peak dispersion. This, in combination with other unique properties resulting from the solid core, allows the use of a 2.7 µm superficially porous particle to achieve the performance of a sub-2 µm fully porous particle while generating less backpressure. If that’s the case, why even consider fully porous particles? These particles have more surface area per gram, allowing both additional retention for poorly retained compounds and the ability to inject more mass on column compared to superficially porous particles.\nLet’s also consider particle size. For the same column dimension, if the particle size is reduced by half, the plate number doubles. However, backpressure also increases by a factor of four. Keeping this in mind, the pressure capabilities of your instrumentation should align with your choice in particle size. Pore size is often overlooked when selecting an LC particle. Small-pore particles have pore sizes ranging from 60–150 $\\mathring{A}$ and perform well during separations of small molecules that are less than approximately 1,000 Da. Large-pore particles tend to be used for separation of larger molecules such as proteins. As a general rule, the pore size should be at least three times the size of hydrodynamic diameter of the molecule for easy access to the pores.\nBefore choosing the particle for your next analytical column, consider the size of your target analytes and whether you need speed, backpressure restrictions, sample capacity, or retention in order to effectively pair your column with your analysis.\nParticle size and pore size #  Figure 1: Particle size and pore size\rParticle size is the average particle size of the packing in the HPLC column.\nThe standard particle size for HPLC columns was 5 µm for a long time, until the mid-1990s, when 3.5 µm became popular for method development. More recently, packings with sub 2.3 µm , including 1.8 µm were developed.\nPore size is the average size of a pore in a porous packing. The pore size of the packing material in your HPLC column is important, since the molecules must \u0026lsquo;fit\u0026rsquo; into the porous structure in order to interact with the stationary phase.\nHow superficially porous particles are synthesized? [3] #  A coacervation method was reported on a poster by Agilent in 2013 which is used to synthesize totally porous silica particles with a very narrow particle size distribution. In the synthesis, a mixture of urea, formaldehyde, and colloidal silica is coacervated under acidic conditions to form spherical particles. The particles are calcined to remove the polymer and then sintered at higher temperature to strengthen the particles. Agilent modified this method to synthesize superficially porous particles (Poroshell 120), in which urea/formaldehyde and sol particles are coacervated around the surface modified solid silica cores that are also added into the coacervation reaction.This procedure is much simpler than the multilayer/multi-multilayer technology as the shell is formed in one step. The critical step is to modify solid core surface with the right chemistry prior to coacervation so that the core surface has a similar chemical reactivity as that of the urea/formaldehyde polymerization. The simpler process leads to a very narrow particle size distribution and more consistent batch-to-batch reproducibility.\nSimplified procedure of preparing Poroshell 120.\n Core preparation:   500-600 nm nanoparticles are prepared by modified Stöber process Cores are continuously grown by adding solutions containing TEOS, ethanol, ammonia, and water into the reaction mixture until they reach the desired size.  Core surface modification:   The cores are bonded with urea-silane first. The core surface is further modified by grafting urea/formaldehyde polymer, making the surface the same chemical reactivity as coacervation chemistry.  Figure : Core Surface Modification Process as a Key for Success of Coating\rCoacervation:   The surface modified cores are added into the coacervation mixture of sol particles, urea, formaldehyde under acidic condition. Urea and formaldehyde polymerize and form coacervated particles with the sol particles and the cores, The coating is formed at one step. The polymers are removed by calcination, and the particles are sintered at elevated temperature and processed to the end.

Here is the procedure of conditioning:\n If you\u0026rsquo;re using an organic mobile phase that\u0026rsquo;s different from the storage solvent, you want to first flush the column with 10% or 20% less organic content. Do this for about 10 column volumes and then change over to the solvent that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be using for your method. If you\u0026rsquo;re using buffers in your method, after about 10 column volumes, switch over to the mobile phase you\u0026rsquo;re going to be using with the buffer included, and then again flush about 10 column volumes. Watch for the baseline to stabilize in pressure because that lets you know the column is equilibrating. Do one or two conditioning injections before running your samples. That’s a good way to kind of prime the column.

I always begin by inspecting the fittings that will be screwed into the column body. If using a PEEK fitting, for standard HPLC pressures be sure that your tubing is cut square and the fitting threads are in good shape. Many times, I even swap out a traditional PEEK fitting for a hand-tight EXP fitting. The nice thing about the EXP fittings is that the PEEK/titanium non-swaged ferrule allows for repeated installations without compromising the high-pressure seal. When making the shift to UHPLC, the EXP fittings can be used at pressures greater than 1000+ bar using a wrench and an extra quarter to half turn.\nOnce you’ve chosen the appropriate fittings, be sure to check your column label for flow direction and insert your fitting into the column end. I like to push the tubing into the column as I’m securing the fitting—this ensure that a zero-dead-volume connection is made. After your column is connected, turn on your pump’s flow and be confident you’ve made a leak-free connection!\nColumn Care #  Sigma-Adrich Guide #  Deterioration #  Regardless of whether the column contains a bonded reversed or normal phase, ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic interaction, size exclusion, or resin/silica based packing, the most common problem associated with analytical columns is deterioration. Symptoms of deterioration are poor peak shape, split peaks, shoulders, loss of resolution, decreased retention times, and high back pressure. These symptoms indicate contaminants have accumulated on the frit or column inlet, or there are voids, channels, or a depression in the packing bed.\nDeterioration is more evident in higher efficiency columns. For example, a 3 micron packing retained by 0.5 micron frits is more susceptible to plugging than a 5 or 10 micron packing retained by 2 micron or larger frits. Proper column protection and sample preparation are essential to getting the most from each column.\nOverloading a column can cause poor peak shapes and other problems.\nDeactivation #  Samples and mobile phases containing very strongly polar solvents, such as water or alcohols, can deactivate uncoated silica HPLC columns.\n Source Sigma-Aldrich\nColumn Protection #  Sigma-Adrich Guide #  Although not an integral part of most equipment, mobile phase inlet filters, pre-injector and pre-column filters, and guard columns greatly reduce problems associated with complex separations. We recommend that all samples be filtered through 0.45 μm or 0.2 μm syringe filters. We strongly recommend the use of guard columns.\nFilters and guard columns prevent particles and strongly retained compounds from accumulating on the analytical column. The useful life of these disposable products depends on mobile phase composition, sample purity, pH, etc. As these devices become contaminated or plugged with particles, pressure increases and peaks broaden or split. As an example, Figure 1 presents a clear case for the use of guard columns.\nFigure 1: Supelguard Columns Prolong the Lifespan of Your Analytical Columns\r Source Sigma-Aldrich\nRestek Guide #   Because guard columns will add some extra column volume to your separation, you might consider to minimize the thickness of filter.\nColumn Cleaning #  Thermo Guide #  In all instances, the volume of solvent used is 40 – 60 column volumes unless otherwise stated.\nThe column efficiency, capacity factor etc. should be measured at the start and end of the clean-up procedure to ensure that it has been performed successfully and has improved the column performance.\nEnsure that no buffers/samples are present on the column and that the solvent used prior to the clean up is miscible with the first wash solvent.\nAfter the clean up, ensure that the test mobile phase is compatible with the last solvent in the column.\n Source Thermo\nShodex Guide #  When a column is deteriorated by the foreign substances remaining in the column or adsorbed by the packing material, the substances might be washed out by the procedure described below. However, sometimes the procedure is not suffcient to regenarate the column and, in such case, it is necessary to replace the column with a new one. And, even if the column can be regenarated, the column performance may be not so good as before. After cleaning the column, be sure to replace the in-column solvent to the normal solvent. The use of a guard column at the up-stream of the main column is recommended to prevent the main column from the deterioration by the foreign substances. When a guard column is used, first, the guard column will be deteriorated by the foreign substances and it is possible to prevent the main column from the deterioration by replacing the guard column regularly.\nWhen cleaning a guard column, be sure to disconnect the main column before the cleaning. If a guard column and a main column are connected in series and the cleaning procedure is performed, foreign substances in the guard column may move to the main column and, as the consequence, the main column may be deteriorated.\nFigure : \r Source Shodex\nReversed Phase Media #  Thermo Guide #   Flush with HPLC grade water; inject 4 aliquots of 200 µL DMSO during this flush Flush with methanol Flush with chloroform Flush with methanol  Note: Normal Phase Media, Anion Exchange Media, Cation Exchange Media, Protein Size Exclusion Media are not included.

Cleaning the column requires the use of a stronger solvent than the mobile phase. The minimum volume for the solvent used to clean the analytical column is 10 column volume.\nTo clean the column in the opposite direction, proceed as follows.\n Disconnect the column from the detector. Then leaving the tubing at the end of the column and place it in a beaker that receives the liquid. Rinse with a mobile phase without buffer salts (water/organic phase) firstly. Then rinse with 100% organic phase (methanol and acetonitrile). Check that the pressure returns to normal, and if not, proceed to the next step. Discard the column or consider washing with stronger conditions. E.g. 75% Acetonitrile/25% Isopropanol, 100% Isopropanol, 100% Dichloromethane, 100% Hexane.

Buffer salts may precipitate and cause backpressure within the column. Pass the column slowly with hot water to remove the precipitation. A rinse solution containing propanol will generate higher operating pressures due to increased viscosity. The flow rate needs to be reduced during the rinse to maintain a safe operating pressure. To avoid precipitation, if the system does not contain a non-volatile buffer, the system is first flushed with an aqueous buffer-free mobile phase before the pure organic solvent enters the system.  Regeneration can\u0026rsquo;t recover the HPLC column with 100% efficiency #  High column pressure problems may not be caused by a blocked column but by a damaged gasket in the system and particles deposited on the inline filter head, which should be replaced before cleaning the column.\nDo not replace the column sieve plate at random. It may cause irreversible damage to the column.\nIf the deterioration in quantitative analysis is due to a decrease in separation, this column should be discarded and replaced.\n Galak source\nSigma-Aldrich Guide #  Silica Column #  Flush with the following:\n 50 mL hexane 50 mL methylene chloride 50 mL 2-propanol 50 mL methanol 25 mL methylene chloride 25 mL mobile phase Evaluate column performance according to conditions specified by the manufacturer.

Alternatively, make one or more 100 μL injections of trifluoroethanol (determine the number of injections by evaluating column performance after each injection). Evaluate column performance.  Nonbonded Silica Columns Exposed to Polar Solvent #  Samples and mobile phases containing very strongly polar solvents, such as water or alcohols, can deactivate uncoated silica HPLC columns. This can drastically affect column performance, particularly solute retention and selectivity. (Figure C2). Even prolonged column flushing with a nonpolar solvent only partially restores column performance, while wasting chemicals. A silica regeneration solution quickly and inexpensively restores silica column performance by removing trapped polar material. Pump the solution through the affected column for 10 minutes at a rate of 4 mL/minute, then flush with mobile phase for 10 minutes at a rate of 2 mL/minute. Evaluate column performance by using the test mixture for evaluating silica columns (Cat. No. 58281). Performance should be virtually the same as before the polar solvent was introduced (Figure C3).\nFigure C: Regeneration Solution Restores Silica Column Performance\rDr. Egidijus Machtejevas, Analytix, Vol 7 | p30 #  Any HPLC or UHPLC column can typically be used for only a limited number of injections. Correct usage and maintenance of the column extends its lifetime and benefits the economy of the method. It is important to follow generally accepted chromatography practices, like adequate sample preparation (sample should be filtered through 0.45 µm membrane filter for HPLC and 0.22 µm filter for UHPLC); suitable quality/purity of the mobile phase (for example, isocratic grade solvents for isocratic mode, gradient grade solvents for gradient elution); filtered mobile phase, well developed method with sufficiently strong elution to minimize unspecific sorption; temperature, pH, and maximum backpressure ranges compatible with selected column. Also important to mention is that the total number of injections is inversely proportional to the volume of the sample injected, e.g., if 10 µL sample is applied per injection and this results in a column lifetime of 5000 injections, then an increased sample load of 100 µL per injection would typically shorten column lifetime to approximately 500 injections. Even if all the above listed points are carefully followed, users sometimes feel that column lifetime should be longer. In order to find out how to extend the lifetime of the column, it is first necessary to understand what causes the aging of the column.\n  Column contamination/clogging by particles. Keep in mind that your column is a very efficient filter. Any particulate material coming from the mobile phase or sample will contaminate frits, and some particles might also migrate into the column packing. This will result in an increase in column backpressure. This creates more stress for the pump and can cause a column to settle, creating a void which result in peak splitting.\n  Unspecific sorption. An HPLC column can encounter many different substances during its use, such as salts from buffers or impurities from the mobile phase and sample. These materials can have lesser or greater retention than the analytes separated. These undesired interferences, if observed by the detector, appear as ghost peaks, blobs, baseline upsets or even negative peaks. Absorbed impurities might negatively contribute to retention mechanism (shorten retention) or begin to act as a new stationary phase (increased retention).\n  Column repacking. Every particle packed column contains a range of particle sizes. Particle size distribution might be wider or narrower. During chromatographic analysis, columns will experience pressure stresses when a non-pressurized injection loop is connected to a pressurized column. During these pressure stresses, the column packing is getting shocked, then particles might swap positions, causing the generally bigger particle to go up (towards column inlet), and the smaller down (towards column outlet). After a number of injections, smaller particles will accumulate at the bottom, and bigger at the top. The smaller particle zone then has a higher packing density backpressure, which users will observe due to the steady increase in backpressure. This again creates more pressure for the instrument and can cause a column to settle, creating a void and consequently peak splitting.\n  Many customers are asking for procedures which could regenerate a column to the initial performance level in order to extend column lifetime. Therefore, the importance of very carefully reading the instruction sheet which comes with every column cannot be overstressed. The sheet also contains information about suggested column care and regeneration procedures. This advice must be followed and can be different from column/phase type to column/ phase type. However, we can theoretically analyze how efficient column regeneration might be. Column contamination at the inlet by particles should generally be easily removed by washing the column for about 5 to 20 column volumes in a backflush mode, but only if the column manufacturer allows it. It is important to make sure that both column frits (inlet and outlet) have the same porosity. Please keep in mind that small impurity particles trapped deeper in the column packing are very unlikely to be removed. As a result of this washing, the column backpressure should be somewhat decreased. To remove unspecifically bound material from the column is often more difficult and the outcome is usually unpredictable, because typically we do not know what compounds these contaminants contain. The success ratio might be from 0 to 100%. To fully restore column packing uniformity for columns packed with smaller than 5 µm particles is very unlikely. Normally column backflush only helps for a short time.\nSo, what is the most reliable and certain solution offered for this topic? The use of guard columns! Guard columns will filter all particles, accumulate unspecific adsorbed materials, and will also extend the lifetime of the analytical main columns used at marginally alkaline pH. Typically, when the guard column is replaced, a majority of the problems will be eliminated, and even more importantly, it will occur without any lengthy time and solvent consuming washing procedure with questionable outcome. Important note: the Guard column must be the same particle size as the analytical column, the same modification and the same material type.\nBut how will you know when to replace the guard column? General advice: Replace the guard column when the nature of the sample is changing, when backpressure is increased about 10-15%, or by schedule/time basis (for example, every 200 to 500 injections – depending on the injection volume and sample purity).\nIf you routinely have any problems with the lifetime of your main column, think early enough about guard columns to save yourself analytical headaches.\nColumn Storage #  Dr. Egidijus Machtejevas, Analytix, Vol 8 | p29 #  The concept may seem simple. Once the last chromatogram of the day or the project is finished, we disconnect the column and put it into the drawer. However, what exactly should be done with the column before storing it? Does the procedure vary depending on the planned storage time? There is actually quite a lot to: planned storage time, column modification (stationary phase), buffer concentration, pH, etc. In all the column storage scenarios, special care must be taken if buffers, which provide a microbe friendly environment, are used. In such cases, fresh buffers are to be prepared daily and filtered using 0.45 or 0.22 μm membrane filters. Also adding a small amount of organic solvent (~ 10%) or adding sodium azide (~ 0.05%) in the storage solvent - if buffers are used for storing e.g. needed for some HILIC columns - can be sufficient to prevent microbial growth. The easiest and safest way to store the column, however, is by using the same solvent in which it was delivered to you.\nThis applies in particular to the polymer-based stationary phases. Depending on their material properties, these might not be compatible with some organic solvents.\nFor silica-based normal phase columns, it is typically recommended that heptane or isopropanol are used. I personnaly have also had good experience with dioxane, as it nicely removes residual water, but this cannot be generalized. Some stationary phases such as aminopropyl- or diol-modified stationary phases might be effectively stored in 2-propanol, which is in fact, compatible with both Reversed Phase and Normal Phase modes. Size exclusion columns should be stored in a solvent compatible with the swelling properties of the packing.\nColumn storage may be short, middle, and long term.\nFor short term storage, i.e., overnight, either the mobile phase used in the last analysis can remain in the column, or it is possible that the mobile phase passes at a very low flow rate (especially if the buffer concentration in the mobile phase is high, \u0026gt;50 mM). In these cases, column conditioning can potentially be skipped before continuing the analysis the next day. This option is particularly recommended for normal phase separations, where change in mobile phase composition can result in lengthy re-equilibration. However, if the buffer concentration in the mobile phase is very high (\u0026gt;0.5 M), then the lifetime of the pump parts (e.g. injector \u0026amp; switching valves) could depend on the length of time they are in contact with high concentration buffer. The same is true for the column if the pH is close to the limit of the column (for most silica-based columns - pH 2 to pH 7). Some salts, such as chloride salts used in ion chromatography in particular, are very corrosive to stainless steel and might attack the column wall as well as the inlet-outlet frits. In such cases, column (and all system) should be flushed with a less harsh mobile phase. In this case, I would recommend rinsing the column with a water-rich mobile phase (~90%) with about 10 column volumes (the approximate column volumes for some popular dimension are listed in Table 1).\nTable 1.

The worst-case scenario is an improperly washed column previously used with a high salt concentration and allowed to dry over time, resulting in the formation of salt crystals. The column most likely will be irreversibly damaged. However, it might be permissible for some columns to be stored dry, others should not. Please check the manufacturer’s column care guidelines. Standard HPLC columns should only be stored at room temperature and never in a freezer (exceptions are protein modified affinity or active enzyme reactor columns). This paragraph’s recommendations are also valid for mid- and long-term column storage.\nMedium interval storage, i.e., 2 days or over the weekend. Columns should be flushed. Flush intensity or volume depends on the buffer concentration used during analysis. It is generally advisable to first flush buffering agents off the column with about 10 column volumes of mobile phase with 10% organic solvent in the water. In this case, washing will be effective, and we would also avoid buffer precipitation and possible column dewetting problems. When the buffer is washed out, pump 100% organic for 15 column volumes. The column could then be left connected to the instrument or disconnected and closed with end plugs. Please consider short term column storage advice too, such as referencing column documentation for recommended storage solvent.\nStoring a HILIC column in an acetonitrile–water mixture may take a long time to re-equilibrate if a low ionic strength buffer such as 5 mM ammonium acetate is used for the analytical method. Therefore, for HILIC columns, it is recommended that they are stored in solvents containing 80–90% acetonitrile and buffers containing 5–10 mM ammonium acetate or ammonium formate. But for some HILIC phases this may differ, please check the column product information. Ion-exchange and mixed-mode phases containing carboxylic acid functional groups (for example, weak cation-exchange phases) cannot be stored in solutions containing alcohols, because of a possible slow esterification and the resulting change in selectivity/capacity.\nFor long term storage (\u0026gt;2-3 days), silica based columns, after proper washing with a minimum of 15 column volumes (Table 1) using ~ 10% organic solvent in water, should then be flushed with an organic-rich mobile phase for a minimum of 10 column volumes and should then be stored in an aprotic solvent. If water is also present, it should not be in higher concentrations (less than 50%). The best storing solvent recommended in the literature is acetonitrile or methanol (some exceptions exist, such as columns with amide modification, which should be stored in acetonitrile only). Some studies1 also indicate that at RP conditions, rates of erosion and corrosion of the stainless steel components of the HPLC using pure acetonitrile or methanol were higher compared to when they were mixed with water. Therefore, 90% acetonitrile or methanol are perfect long-term storage agents for most reverse-phase columns. However, my personal favorite storage solution is a mixture of isopropanol and water (80/20), because of isopropanol’s higher vapor pressure and the reduced chance for column dry-out, even if end fittings are not completely sealed. Isopropanol is also a stronger eluent, therefore, after storing in isopropanol, we can be sure that even more impurities will be removed than with acetonitrile or methanol gradients. Last but not least, isopropanol is also less toxic. It is also important to note that all mobile phases used for flushing, washing, or column storing must be of the same quality grade as the ones used for the analysis. Columns should be stored at room temperature (exceptions include affinity columns, as mentioned before) in their original box, with a copy of the certificate of analysis (CoA)/Column Report, and possibly with the column log book to show previous uses and to help the user evaluate the column prior to future use.\nHow long can columns be stored? This depends on many factors. Some columns do not change even after 5 or 10 years of storage. If you decide to use a column after such a long period of time, assume that the column most likely has dried out, and needs to be rewetted by first flushing with 100% acetonitrile (RP-phases), and then equilibrated in mobile phase for about 1 hour before making any selectivity measurements. Additionally, consider running a column test mix and compare the data to the CoA or previous column tests.\nCorrect column storage is essential for proper chromatography and a prolonged column life. In addition, always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for column operation details!\nReference\n R.A. Mowery, Jr., The Corrosion of 316 Stainless Steel in Process Liquid Chromatography with Acetonitrile or Methanol Carriers, J.

You can use a solvent mix similar to initial run conditions, just without additives, and that can be good for a couple days of storage. For longer term storage, you should choose a storage solvent appropriate to your column and method. And always make sure to document the date and storage solvent, so you have the information you need to get back up and running as soon as possible.\nColumn Operating Temperature #  Thermo Guide #  Fluctuations in temperature can cause peak drift and other undesirable effects in your chromatography.\nIn applications where the column will be maintained at temperatures above or below ambient, it is also worth considering the use of a solvent heater. The effect of solvent heating prior to analysis is shown below.\nFigure : Pre-heater\rThe recommended operating temperatures for columns is very much dependent on the analytical conditions and the packing inside the column. Typically, carbon and polymer based columns can be used at far higher temperatures than can a silica based column. This is because elevated temperatures increase the risk of chemical attack on the bonding and base silica by the solvent. For example, at 60 °C and with a buffer at pH 2, a silica based amide column packing can start to hydrolyze. This would drastically affect the chromatography available from the column.\nThe choice of particle size is also a contributing factor when considering operating temperature. Particles below 5 µm in diameter are more prone to bed collapse and loss of efficiency at highly elevated temperatures.\nTemperature can be a powerful method development tool if it is used correctly. Lower temperatures can be used to help increase retention, selectivity and resolution. Higher temperatures can be used to help decrease retention, selectivity and resolution.\n"},{"id":205,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-03-HPLC-Columns/Column_Classification/","title":"Column Classification System","section":"Part 03 HPLC Columns","content":"Figure : \rColumns are characterized by 4 column parameters, which are determined with 3 simple, fast, repeatable and reproducible chromatographic methods.

Depending on the column, one chromatogram takes about 20 to 30 minutes.\n  Wash the column according to the manufacturers' recommendations.\n  4. Calculation of the column parameters #  First, calculate the parameter values for each injection, then calculate the mean value for the three injections.\nMethod A:\n- the relative retention factor of benzylamine/phenol at pH 2.7, rk' benzylamine/phenol pH 2.7\n$ \\frac{Tr(benzylamine) - Tr(uracil)}{Tr(phenol) - Tr(uracil)} $\nMethod B:\n- the retention factor of 2,2'-dipyridyl, k' 2,2-dipyridyl\n$ \\frac{Tr(2,2'-dipyridyl)-Tr(uracil)}{Tr(uracil)} $\nMethod C:\n- the retention factor of amylbenzene, k' amylbenzene\n$ \\frac{Tr(amylbenzene)-Tr(uracil)}{Tr(uracil)} $\n- the relative retention factor of triphenylene/o-terphenyl, rk' triphenylene/o-terphenyl\n$ \\frac{Tr(triphenylene) - Tr(uracil)}{Tr(o-terphenyl) - Tr(uracil)} $\nColumn Classification System Ranking #  Ranking based on F-Value\nAll columns in the database are characterized by 4 column parameters: the retention factor of amylbenzene, k' amylbenzene, the relative retention factor of triphenylene/o-terphenyl, rk' triphenylene/o-terphenyl, the relative retention factor of benzylamine/phenol at pH 2.7, rk' benzylamine/phenol pH 2.7, the retention factor of 2,2'-dipyridyl, k' 2,2-dipyridyl.\nThe column classification starts with the selection of a reference column. As all columns are characterized by 4 column parameters, a classification of RP-LC C18 columns, based on the similarity of their column parameters to the parameters of a reference column, can be obtained. In order to do so an F-value has been introduced. The F-value expresses the similarity of a column to the reference column. The smaller the F-value, the more similar is the column to the reference column.\nThe column classification system classifies all columns from the database according to their F-value. The smaller the F-value, the higher the column is positioned in the classification. This means that columns with a selectivity similar to the reference column are found high in the ranking (= high ranked columns ).\nThe larger the F-value, the lower the column is positioned in the classification. This means that columns with a selectivity different from the reference column are found at low positions in the ranking (= low ranked columns ).\nConclusion: High ranked columns are columns with a selectivity similar to the reference column. Low ranked columns are columns with a selectivity different from the reference column.\nThe column classification system also allows the comparison of two columns, which are not included in the database. Characterize your two columns (preferably before use). You can enter these two sets of 4 parameter values. The first column is considered as the reference column. When the classification system classifies the columns, the F-value of the second column is also calculated and classified among the other columns in the database.\nThe column classification system allows the comparison of two batches of one type of column. Characterize two columns from different batches (preferably before use). You can enter these two sets of 4 parameter values. The first set is considered as the reference column (reference batch). When the classification system classifies the columns, the F-value of the second column (batch 2) is also calculated and classified among the other columns in the database. If the type of stationary phase you want to examine is included in the database, you can compare your reference batch with the batch in the database as well.\nThe column classification system allows the follow-up of column ageing. Characterize a column before usage (new column). When this column has been used in your lab for some time (\u0026ldquo;used\u0026rdquo; column), it can be characterized again. The column classification system allows you to enter these 2 sets of 4 parameter values. The first set will be used as reference and should contain the 4 parameter values of the new column. In the second set you enter the 4 parameter values measured on the used column.\nAn F-value close to zero for the second column (column on top of the classification) indicates that the column properties of the two columns are similar. If you compare two batches of columns, it means that the column properties of the two batches are similar and if you follow up column ageing, it means that the properties of your used column did not change. If the column is not found on top of the classification (F is not close to zero), the two columns (or two column batches, or the used and new column) show different properties. In that case, the column classification system allows you to find columns similar to your reference column.\nConclusion: The column classification system allows the comparison of different (batches of) columns or the follow up of column ageing. F-values close to 0 (column on top of the classification) for the second column indicate column properties similar to the reference column.\n  source\n"},{"id":206,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-03-HPLC-Columns/Column_comparison_table/","title":"Column Comparison Table","section":"Part 03 HPLC Columns","content":"Figure : \rTable 1 : Selected Waters, Agilent, Phenomenex Columns\r\r\r\rColumn Name\nBonded-Phase\nWaters Closest Selectivity Column\n\rWaters Recommended UPLC Column\nWaters Recommended HPLC Column\nWaters Recommended Preparative Column\n\r\r\r\rInfinityLab Poroshell 120 HPH C18\nC18\nCORTECS T3\n\rCORTECS T3\nCORTECS T3\nAtlantis T3 OBD\n\r\rKinetex EVO C18\nC18\nXTerra Phenyl\n\rCORTECS C18+\nCORTECS C18+\n XBridge BEH Shield RP18 OBD\n\r\rKinetex Phenyl Hexyl\nPhenyl\nACQUITY UPLC CSH Fluoro-Phenyl\nXSelect CSH Fluoro-Phenyl\n\rACQUITY UPLC CSH Fluoro-Phenyl\nXSelect CSH Fluoro-Phenyl\nXSelect CSH Fluoro-Phenyl XP\nXBridge BEH Phenyl OBD\n\r\r\r\r Source Waters\n"},{"id":207,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-03-HPLC-Columns/Column_parameters_guide/","title":"Column Parameters Guide","section":"Part 03 HPLC Columns","content":"To Compare different core-shell columns.\nColumn Parameters (Bonded Phase Type, L, $d_p$, $d_c$) #  While the C18 stationary phase is traditionally used, the selectivity of different bonded phases is often exploited for the separation of closely eluting pairs of key analytes in critical analyses. Column screening with a variety of stationary phases that offers different retention mechanisms can occur during either initial method development or the fine-tuning steps but may be dependent on the availability of suitable samples. Automated column/mobile phase screening systems equipped with multiport selection valves (Figure 10.5) are typically used with an “orthogonal” column set (e.g. C18 ( C8), C18 AQ, phenyl, cyano, polar-embedded, and pentafluorophenyl).\nColumn dimensions (L, $\\textrm{d}_p$, $\\textrm{d}_c$) are matched to the intended application and can be optimized to enhance efficiency, speed, or sensitivity. One useful strategy is to use short UHPLC columns (50 × 3.0 mm, sub-3-μm) for rapid column/mobile phase screening, followed by optimization with longer columns (to maximize resolution) using the selected bonded phase [5].

They were called pellicular particles at the beginning of their invention by Horvath. These particles are made of a solid silica core surrounded by a layer of porous silica with the intention to reduce the average diffusion paths of analytes across the particles. This type of particle was commercialized by Kirkland though the major breakthrough for modern LC was in 2007 when 2.7 μm superficially porous particles appeared on the market. These particles were made of a 1.7 μm solid silica core and covered with a 0.5 μm porous shell, also referred to as fused-core particles. Since then, sub-3 μm and sub-2 μm core\u0026ndash;shell particles have been commercially available from numerous manufacturers with slightly varying core to shell ratio. For instance, 2.6 μm Kinetex particles from Phenomenex consist of 1.9 μm solid core and a 0.35 μm porous silica layer.\nPro #  The exceptional efficiency of columns packed with core\u0026ndash;shell particles is comparable with sub-2 μm fully porous particles, yet with much lower backpressure. This makes it practically useful for labs equipped only with conventional LC.\nThe high efficiency of core-shell columns lies mainly in the reduction of both the longitudinal diffusion B coefficient (-20 to -30%) and the eddy dispersion A term (\u0026ndash;0%).\nCons #  1) at ultra high pressure, the effect of frictional heating causing temperature gradients within the columns could be an issue.\n2) Meanwhile, the quality of column packing also plays a significant role for the performance of narrow bore columns. 3) The smaller the internal diameter of the column, the more critical the extra-column band broadening effects are. In other words, efficiency of columns of 3 mm inner diameter would be less affected by extra-column volume than the narrow bore columns. For Cortecs columns (Waters) of 1.6 m particles, 2.1 mm inner diameter were chosen as they have the same dimension as the fully porous BEH C18, 1.7 μm column (100 × 2.1 mm, tested for comparison).\nConsequence, different core-shell columns could affect technology transfer aspects of methods.\nList of Core-shell C_18 Columns #  Table 1: Core-shell columns tested\rColumn Characterization Protocols #   PQRI methodology; NIST SRM 870 test; Modified Tanaka test;  Tanaka test assesses selectivity and performance differences between LC columns.\nA set of seven selected substances is used to describe retention factor, hydrophobicity, steric selectivity, and silanophilic properties.\nGood batch to batch reproducibility of columns are extremely important to develop a robust method for pharmaceutical analysis. Four selected active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are selected to gain the insight of the batch-to-batch reproducibility of studied core\u0026ndash;shell columns. For this test, not only retention factor, but also column efficiency and peak shape of these four APIs are compared for different batches of the same type column. The selected APIs are more representative for the real-life applications than Tanaka test probes. Hence Tanaka protocols were not used for the batch to batch reproducibility test in this study.\nFour API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) #  Table 2: Structure and relevant pka value of four API\r   Compound Structure pKa     Metoprolol  9.43   Omeprazole  4.27 and 8.76   Amlodipine  8.97   Felodipine  NA    Tanaka Test Results #  Table 3: Tanaka test results and column back pressure\rConclusion #   Kinetex EVO columns have lower retention factors for pentylbenzene and shape selectivity. Cortecs C18+ distinguish themselves in the high values (lilac) of $\\alpha_{C/P}$ and $\\alpha_{B/P}$ pH 2.7, which indicates the high acidic silanol activity of this stationary phase and low degree of end capping. This is surprising since Cortecs C18+ is claimed to have the same chemistry as CSH (charged surface hybrid) columns with permanent surface charge. Poroshell 120 Bonus-PR column is an outlier on the score plot, which is as expected as it is a non-C18 stationary phase. It is a combination of denselyreacted sterically-protected, diisopropyl-C14 groups covalently bonded through an embedded amide functionality to a silica support. Poroshell EC-C18, 2.7 μm, Kinetex C18 2.6 μm and Cortecs C18 1.6 μm showed the best batch-to-batch reproducibility. Core–shell columns in dimensions of 100×3 mm and of particles 2.6 to 2.7 μm tested in this study do have better or at least the same efficiency compared with fully porous BEH C18, 1.7 μm column, while the backpressure is much lower.

As we wish to maintain a pH of 7.0 to enable reproducible separation, and because the pKa of the phosphate buffer is 7.21, this obeys the general rule that the buffer will be most effective when the desired solution pH is within 1pH unit of its native pKa. This should lead to an improvement in the robustness of retention time and peak shape. We will discuss this particular reagent and the eluent pH later.\nSodium heptane sulphonate is a so‑called ion-pairing reagent and has two modes of action. In the bulk mobile phase, the anionic reagent will form an ionic equilibrium with basic analyte functional moieties to form a neutral complex, which will be more highly retained on the highly hydrophobic stationary phase surface. The second mode of action of the ion-pair reagent is to strongly partition into the stationary phase via the highly hydrophobic moiety of the pairing reagent, which will effectively contribute anionic groups ($\\small{\\textrm{SO}^{3-}}$) to the stationary-phase surface, with which any unpaired cationic analyte species may undergo electrostatic attraction, and therefore improve retention.\nApart from its use to obtain the correct mobile phase pH, triethylamine is used as a silanol group masking reagent. Figure 2 can give us further insight into the mechanism and requirement for this reagent.\nFigure 2: Representations of various silica surface species (note C8 ligands shown in the figure - C18 ligands are recommended in the pharmacopoeial method\rSpecies 5 in Figure 2 represents an acidic silanol group that has not been effectively treated with an end-capping reagent (such as that shown in species 8), which will be anionic under the mobile-phase conditions of our method (species 5 will have a pKa of around 4). If left untreated, these silanol anions will form electrostatic attractions with cationic analyte molecules and unwanted secondary interactions and can lead to issues with peak broadening and tailing, as well as extended column equilibration times and possible issues with peak area reproducibility. Therefore, ionogenic masking reagents such as triethylamine were traditionally added to mobile phases to effectively “end-cap” anionic surface sites, as the triethylamine, which is fully protonated below pH 7.2, is electrostatically attracted to the ionized surface silanol residues.\nThe Column #  The so-called bridged ethylene hybrid columns were introduced by Waters around 2004 to fulfil several requirements including improved peak shape for charged (especially cationic) analytes, increased ruggedness under ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) conditions, and increased resistance to extremes of eluent pH (especially high pH) using organic/inorganic hybrid substrates.\nHowever, we must go back even further to highlight some of the issues with the method under consideration. The lone (acidic) silanol groups that are masked using the triethylamine additive were particularly prevalent when manufacturers used Type A silica as stationary-phase substrate materials. This silica contained metal ions known to “activate” surface silanol groups towards interaction with basic analytes and was typically not treated to avoid the presence of lone silanol groups. The later development of Type B silica effectively reduced silanol activity by removing target metal ions from the silica matrix and used surface treatments to reduce the number of lone silanols and promote the amount of inter-hydrated or vicinal silanol groups (species 2 in Figure 2). These developments were very effective at reducing the interactions between basic analytes and surface silanol species, effectively negating the requirement for masking reagents such as triethylamine. The bridged ethylene phases (species 1 in Figure 2) are known to further reduce the number of inherent silanol species capable of interaction with basic analytes in their ionized state.\nOne must therefore question, given the fact that due to these new stationary‑phase materials the use of silanol masking reagents has not been required for over 20 years now, why triethylamine is included in this method.\nFurther, triethylamine is relatively volatile and will be lost from the mobile phase to the atmosphere on standing, causing drift in analyte retention over time as the inherent pH of the mobile phase will change as the triethylamine concentration lowers. In my own experience, it is also possible for the triethylamine to “settle” within the eluent, again leading to drifting or changing analyte retention. Further problems with this reagent also exist. Because it inherently alters the stationary‑phase surface, one has to be mindful when equilibrating the HPLC column because extended flushing of the phase is often necessary to obtain reproducible retention times for the first injections of a sequence. One also must question the possible interaction between the anionic ion-pairing reagent and the triethylamine cation. The possibility of this interaction, forming a neutral complex, may render the masking reagent ineffective, and one needs to wonder what robustness issues this may create.\nLet’s now consider the role of the ion‑pairing reagent in this separation. Modern stationary phases, such as those used in this method, are capable of withstanding high pH mobile-phase environments, and as such we must also call into question the use of this type of buffer in the method. In this separation, the analytes have several basic functional groups ranging from 7.25 to 10.0 and therefore it is conceivable that, by adjusting the mobile-phase pH to pH 10.5 or 11, the degree of ionization of some of the analyte basic moieties will be reduced and retention may be gained, even using the more hydrophobic C18 stationary phase. Further, there are many stationary phases available that contain more polar functional chemistry or are designed to work with very little or no organic modifier within the mobile phase at the beginning of the mobile-phase gradient to facilitate retention of more polar or ionized analytes. The use of ion-pairing reagents, such as sodium heptane sulphonate, has not been necessary for many years, since the introduction of higher quality silica, combined with more polar (so-called polar embedded) and more pH-resistant stationary phases, can be used to gain sufficient reversed-phase retention, even for more polar analytes.\nThe column contains 1.7 mm particles that are designed for use with UHPLC systems, given the higher inherent back pressure created when using such small diameter particles. Intrinsically, these systems have very small internal volumes and very narrow internal diameter tubing and connectors, reducing the effects of extracolumn (bed) band broadening on the separation. The use of a solid, involatile buffer with UHPLC systems is to be avoided, as any precipitation of the buffer through the use of highly organic eluents or via evaporation of the mobile phase on standing will lead to significant problems with system blockages and overpressure situations. Further, the column end frits used with UHPLC columns containing 1.7 mm particles typically have a porosity of around 0.2 mm, which renders them even more susceptible to blockages with solid particles. It is possible to filter the eluent solution to remove any particulate materials initially present in the eluent system; however, one must again be very mindful that the triethylamine additive is relatively volatile, and this may be partially lost if filtration is achieved using vacuum apparatus. The target eluent pH of 7.0 is also relatively problematic. Given that the pKa of at least one of the ionogenic analyte functional groups in each of the analytes was close to 7.0, we might expect a relatively large change in the ionic character of the analyte, and therefore its retention, unless the pH of the mobile phase is very accurately controlled each time it is made. To ensure the method is robust, it would have been better to quote a volume or weight of triethylamine required to achieve the desired pH, which could be controlled much more reproducibly.\nIt should be further noted that the detection is at a fixed wavelength of 254 nm, and this can be problematic when the ionic strength of the mobile phase changes to such a large extent during the analysis, as is the case here, where the aqueous component ranges from 90% to 15% during the course of the analysis. Without the judicious setup of the detector, for example, by employing an appropriate reference wavelength to account for differences in the refractive index of the eluent, such changes in ionic strength might well give rise to retention time shifts, peak shape changes, and unstable and rising baselines during the gradient unless sufficient time is given to allow re-equilibration of the column between sample injections. It may be far more judicious to use a ternary system in which the ionic strength is maintained using a third eluent system that contains the buffer and additives at a higher concentration (such as all reagents at 10× concentration and added at a constant 10% of mobile-phase composition during the analysis).\nFrom this brief review it would very much appear that the current method has been “stitched together” using a very traditional mobile phase with a modern stationary phase, which should not require any of the now “exotic” mobile-phase additives to achieve a suitable separation. Without the requisite experience in critical evaluation of chromatography methods, this combination may be baffling and the resulting problems very difficult to interpret or overcome.\nSummary #  Let’s summarize some of the detective work that we have undertaken to start building our investigative toolkit.\n  The use of phosphate or other solid buffers suggests that the method is \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo;, and these buffers usually preclude the use of mass spectrometry (MS) detection and present issues with system blockages under high organic strength mobile phases.\n  The use of ion-pairing reagents such the sulphonic acids or alkyl amines again suggest the method is older. These reagents were typically used in conjunction with older stationary-phase types, and their need can often be negated by judicious selection of a more modern stationary phase that is capable of retaining ionized analytes. Further, the use of ion-pairing reagents can present real challenges with column equilibration.\n  By studying the physicochemical parameters of the analyte, it may be possible to suppress analyte ionization using pH control and modern stationary phases that will withstand eluent pH values between (approximately) 2 and 11.\n  The use of “exotic” additives within mobile phases such as triethylamine should ring alarm bells in terms of the robustness of the method and the potential issues with peak tailing, due to their association with older, less inert, stationary-phase chemistries and substrates.\n  One should always consider the analyte structure and the polarity (LogP, LogD) and the pKa of any ionogenic functional groups with respect to the mobile phase being used. It is a real skill to be able to visualize the degree of ionization of each analyte and anticipate any issues with retention and resolution under the mobile-phase conditions specified.\n  Eluent pH values that closely approach the pKa of any ionogenic groups will present potential robustness issues with retention and resolution of the separation. Further, methods that specify the eluent components volumetrically rather than gravimetrically should, where possible, be converted to gravimetric specification to enable more accurate mobile-phase preparation.\n  The ionic strength of the eluent additives can give clues as to the quality of the method and where high ionic strength (above 25 mM) is required, this highlights several possible issues in implementation. High ionic strength can indicate that robustness can only be achieved by significantly altering the nature of the stationary phase, and there may be issues with a mismatch between the analyte diluent and the mobile phase. These phases will also require significantly extended column equilibration times. High ionic strength mobile phases that use solid buffers can present significant issues with system blockage, especially where eluent conditions reach \u0026gt;60% acetonitrile or \u0026gt;95% methanol during the gradient.\n  Eluent gradients that present a significant change in ionic strength can present issues with baseline stability, especially when using UV detection. These problems can be minimized through careful optimization of the reference wavelength; however, the general principle should be to minimize ionic strength of the eluent and the change in ionic strength throughout the gradient.\n   Source LCGC\n Figure : \r"},{"id":214,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-07-Application/Degassing_flat_film_degasser/","title":"Flat Film Degasser","section":"Part 07 Application","content":"The Background of Degassing #  Reducing the amount of dissolved air in the HPLC mobile phase has a significant impact on the stability of system flow rate and mobile phase composition. Low pressure mixing HPLC pumps rely on only solvent entering the pump, any outgassing which occurs during transfer from the proportioning valve in to the inlet check valve can cause several types of errors. First, composition errors will occur because the volume in the transfer line contains air, not fluid mobile phase. As a bubble in the transfer line stretches, the accuracy of the mixture continues to be degraded. Finally, a bubble entering the pump can interfere with the inlet check valve such that the pump does not deliver a complete volume of mobile phase to the column, instead pushing a portion back toward the proportioning valve. Additionally, the pump must compress any bubble to the system pressure before delivery of the mobile phase to the column can occur.\nIn high pressure mixing HPLC systems, dissolved gas can affect the operation of the inlet check valve forming microbubbles due to cavitation. As with low pressure mixing HPLC pumps, a bubble will cause incorrect flow which interferes with retention time. This fluctuating flow may also increase system noise in the detector depending on the detector type and sensitivity to flow. Thus, dissolved air affects the accuracy and resolution of separations, and the ability to reliably identify compounds that have been separated on the column. As a result, it has long been the case that essentially all HPLC systems include some form of degassing ranging from bulk degassing with vacuum, helium sparging, ultrasonication to the inline methods using membrane technologies including PTFE membranes and Teflon™ AF.\nToday’s HPLC systems have one of two mobile phase mixing arrangements - either the solvents are mixed before they enter the pump (low-pressure mixing); or alternatively, mobile phase mixing occurs after the pump but before the injection valve (high-pressure mixing). In both cases, efficient in-line vacuum degassing of the mobile phase mixture and its components helps to avoid chromatographic issues.\nIn 1975, Tokunaga published the data set that has formed the foundation for degassing for HPLC solvent mixtures [1]. He determined the Ostwald coefficients for the solubility of oxygen in various alcohol-water mixtures and demonstrated the degree to which mixtures needed to be degassed to prevent bubble formation. This seminal paper has underpinned the development of the tubing-based degassing systems in routine use in most labs today.\nFigure 1: Air Solubility in Various Water and Menthanol Mixtures\rNote: Adapted from Tokunaga, J Chem \u0026 Eng Data Vol 20 No 1 1975 with percentage of remaining air in both solvents shown. Figure 1 plots Tokunaga’s data, recalculated in the way HPLC systems mix mobile phases as volumetric percentages. The difference between the upper solid red line and the Ostwald coefficient data lines represents the supersaturation of the mixtures with dissolved air. Three example lines where the amount of air is reduced by degassing are also shown.\nFrom this data, the actual concentration of air in a mixture that will not outgas at atmospheric conditions is 38%, and this is the target that the majority of degassers are designed to meet (at the flow rate and applied vacuum specific to the particular instrument design requirements).\nChallenging current practice #  In-line degassers in common use today utilise tubular Teflon™ AF or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes. They allow air to pass through the membrane and out of the mobile phase in accordance with Henry’s Law, Dalton’s Law and Raoult’s Law. Operating at a constant vacuum level, they remove air from a mobile phase more efficiently at low flow rate and less so at higher flow. This is due to residency time within the tubing.\nIt is also possible for solvent molecules to move from the mobile phase to the vacuum side of the membrane. Known as pervaporation, this effect can significantly change the concentration of the mobile phase under certain circumstances, and with certain HPLC methodologies. This is because when the vacuum is fixed at a pressure below the vapour pressure of the solvent, the pump will continue to remove both the dissolved air and solvent vapours. So long as the pump is active, the solvent supply bottle replenishes the system and solvent vapour is pumped into the atmosphere. It is therefore desirable to control pervaporation using the vacuum side of the degasser, setting as high a pressure as possible without reaching the point at which outgassing will occur in the HPLC system.\nThis impacts pump and inlet check valve efficiency and can lead to inaccuracies in both mobile phase composition and pumping system flow rate potentially causing method failure because of quantification \u0026amp; identification issues.\nNext-generation degassing technology #  The desirable design features of any new approach to degassing should include:\n• Lower flow restriction than tubing-based degassers\n• Small form factor with no internal tubing fittings to leak\n• Lowest vacuum volume to limit initial pervaporation of volatiles\n• Constant flow restriction regardless of applied vacuum\n• Degassing the mobile phase at the highest pressure possible without allowing the mobile phase to become supersaturated with air. Referred here as ‘high pressure degassing’, this technique reduces or eliminates solvent vapour discharge into the laboratory atmosphere.\n• Degasser integrated into HPLC system control software to enable intelligent control of vacuum to ensure improved degassing efficiency.\nIn addition, a degasser that could be universally applied\n at flow rate ranges as great as 10 mL/min, depending on style of HPLC system and with all common solvents including hexafluoroisopropanol, would be a significant advantage.  There is now a patented flat film membrane, together with a dedicated vacuum pump control algorithm (patent pending), which addresses these goals. Figure 2 shows a schematic of the new flat membrane degasser. It is a simple design that is straightforward to implement into both low pressure and high pressure mixing HPLC systems (Figure 3). The design results in a product with minimal fittings and connections. Its highly efficient membrane has been specified with sufficient surface area to degas solvents for analytical scale HPLC systems (up to 10 mL/min flow rate). The unique flow channel layout delivers a low fluid resistance before the inlet check valve of the pump.\nFigure 2: Unique patented flow channel design. Thin liquid film flows over degassing membrane.\rFigure 3: New degasser integrated into generic low- (left) and high- (right) pressure HPLC systems\rThe companion vacuum control algorithm provides the integration into the separation method control protocol and allows selection of a given degassing efficiency for any HPLC system. Vacuum pressure can be dialled up or down to reach the exact HPLC method specification needed. A simplified interface accepts the flow rate and desired efficiency of degassing for the individual separation method from the HPLC and adjusts the vacuum to the highest pressure possible for efficient degassing. This method prevents dissolved atmospheric supersaturation while suppressing pervaporation and mobile phase concentration changes. The flow restriction is constant, regardless of the applied vacuum.\nIn practice #  The initial evaluation of the new degasser/control algorithm has generated some encouraging data, and positive reports on usability. In order to characterise the degasser, a mathematical model of performance vs. applied vacuum level is derived from running HPLC separations and is stored either in the degasser controller or the HPLC control system. The first step, using the methanol-oxygen charge transfer complex at either 210 nanometers (nm) or 215 nm, is to determine the efficiency of the chamber at different flow rates and applied vacuums.\nFigure 4 illustrates efficiency vs. flow rate at four different vacuum pressures. Note that the maximum flow rate at which 30% residual air (70% efficiency) at 50 mmHg is approximately 2.5 mL/min. This is sufficient to degas a gradient or any isocratic mobile phase up to 5 mL/min, and because an efficiency of 62% (38% residual air, Figure 1) is required to prevent outgassing, an HPLC system equipped with this degasser, operated at 50 mmHg, could be expected to use method flow rates up to 7 mL/min without exhibiting bubble formation.\nFigure 4: Characterisation curves showing efficiency vs flow rate of the film degasser at four different vacuum levels.\rSubsequent steps plot efficiency vs. vacuum levels for each flow rate and solve the efficiency-vacuum curve equations using the desired efficiency and flow rate. The formula of each curve links flow rate to output vacuum level such that once a degassing chamber is characterised, the vacuum level applied to the degasser is a function of the desired efficiency and the flow rate of the method. Degassing performance can then be tuned using vacuum control to cover the entire performance range of an HPLC system. Target degassing efficiency can therefore be constantly assured at any flow rate with minimum concentration changes, or pervaporation, in the mobile phase.\nFigure 5 shows data from an experiment to compare the degassing efficiency of flat film vs. tubing-based systems. It is important to note that the vacuum levels are dramatically different but that the performance of the new film degasser matches that of the tube degasser at the desired flow rate (1 mL/min) and efficiency (70%).\nFigure : Comparing a predicted vacuum level efficiency of 70% at 1 mL/min against a standard 18-inch tube degasser at 50 mmHg vacuum.\rThis demonstrates that any degasser can be characterised, and the resulting sets of data can then be used to control the vacuum degassing system from the inputs of efficiency and method flow rate.\nLooking ahead #  In summary, the development of the flat film degasser and its companion control algorithm described here provides chromatographers with an improved degassing performance when compared to degassing at constant vacuum. The benefits will not only result in improved degassing efficiency, but most importantly, in method reproducibility, lab proficiency and productivity.

RPC has a high peak capacity and is particularly effective for separating small molecules, peptides, nucleotides, and fragments.\nHydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) HILIC is used for the separation of polar and hydrophilic compounds. HILIC stationary phases are polar, similar to normal phase chromatography (NPC), but mobile phases are similar to reversed phase chromatography (RPC). Typical HILIC phases are silica or polymer particles carrying polar functional groups, e.g. hydroxyl, carbamoyl, amino or zwitterionic groups. Typical mobile phases are aqueous buffers with organic modifyers - primarily acetonitrile - applied in isocratic or gradient mode. In HILIC water has the highest elution power. Therefore gradients start with high percentage of acetonitrile. It is commonly believed that in HILIC the aqueous content of the mobile phase creates a water rich layer on the surface of the stationary phase. This allows partitioning of solutes between the more organic mobile phase and the aqueous layer. Hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions are supposed to be the dominating retention mechanisms. The number of polar groups, as well as the conformation and solubility of the sample in the mobile phase determine the elution order. Compared to RPC the elution order in HILIC mode is inversed for most compounds. HILIC is ideally suited for mass spectrometric analysis of water soluble polar compounds, because the high organic content in the mobile phase increases MS detection sensitivity\nHydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC)\nThis is a chromatographic technique in which the sample interacts, at high mobile phase salt concentration, with a hydrophobic stationary phase. Subsequently it is eluted from the stationary phase by decreasing the salt concentration. Almost all biological molecules have in their structure hydrophobic patches that, under physiological conditions, are shielded by hydrophilic or ionic groups. By increasing the salt concentration of the solvent, these hydrophobic patches of the molecule become more exposed and can interact with hydrophobic ligands on the HIC packing. HIC is particularly attractive for protein purification when the sample is solved in high salt concentration. In contrast to the conditions used in RPC, the biological activity of the eluted molecules is often maintained in HIC. It is being used increasingly as a substitute for ammonium sulfate precipitation because of higher throughput and greater recovery of enzymatic activity. The strength of the hydrophobic interaction is influenced strongly by the nature of the salt components in the mobile phase. Starting salt concentration of 1.0 M to 2.5 M ammonium sulfate in the buffer is commonly used to adsorb the sample to the packing. The salt concentration needed depends on the protein hydrophobicity and solubility, the resins hydrophobicity and the resolution, capacity and mass recovery required. Additives commonly used are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, SDS, urea and guanidinium hydrochloride.\nAffinity Chromatography (AFC) AFC is based on the specific adsorption of a molecule to a ligand or\rmacromolecule. Almost all biological molecules can be purified on the basis of\rspecific interaction between their chemical or biological structure and a\rsuitable affinity ligand. Typical molecular pairs are antigens and antibodies,\renzymes and coenzymes, and sugars with lectins. Affinity Chromatography media have ligands that are bonded via a spacer arm to\rthe packing material. A specific biological molecule is then reversibly\radsorbed to the ligand. The adsorbed molecule is eluted either by competitive\rdisplacement or by a change in the conformation of the molecule through a\rchange in pH or ionic strength. Because of the intrinsic high selectivity of Affinity Chromatography, it is, in\rcontrast to other chromatographic methods, most suitable for specific\rseparation problems and provides high purification yields. Another advantage of\rAFC is the simplicity of the elution technique, which involves a single-step gradient. Antibody Affinity columns are used for specific analyses in antibody\rtherapeutics development, such as fast screening of cell lines for antibody\rtiter or activity\nSize Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) SEC is the general name for the chromatographic mode also referred to as gel\rpermeation chromatography (GPC) for non-aqueous elution systems or gel\rfiltration chromatography (GFC) for aqueous systems. SEC is a method in which components of a mixture are separated according to\rtheir molecular size (hydrodynamic volume), based on the flow of the sample\rthrough a porous packing. Large biomolecules that cannot penetrate the pores of\rthe packing material elute first. These large biomolecules are said to be\rexcluded from the packing; they flow with the mobile phase in the interparticle\rspace of the packed column. Smaller molecules can partially or completely enter\rthe stationary phase. Because these smaller molecules have to flow through\rboth, the interparticle space, as well as through the pore volume, they will\relute from the column after the excluded sample components. SEC is a very simple method for separating biomolecules, because it is not\rnecessary to change the composition of the mobile phase during elution.\rHowever, the separation capacity of this method is limited. For a baseline\rseparation it is necessary that the molecular weights of the biomolecules\rdiffer at least 10 to 20 %.\nIon Exchange Chromatography (IEC) Biomolecules generally have charged groups on their surfaces, which change with\rthe pH of the solution. This is the basis for Ion Exchange Chromatography\r(IEC), in which the molecule reversibly binds to an oppositely charged group of\rthe packing material. Molecules with a higher charge density bind more strongly to the packing. The\rbound sample may be selectively removed from the stationary phase by changing\rthe pH or salt concentration of the mobile phase. The higher the charge of the\rmolecule and the stronger the binding to the stationary phase, the greater is\rthe change in the salt concentration required. In IEC it is possible to load\rsamples in a very dilute solution and to elute rapidly with a step gradient,\rthus producing a concentrated sample. IEC is a very powerful separation tool because it is highly selective and\rspecific and has a high capacity. Although the technique is used for a variety\rof samples, it is particularly effective for proteins because they are\ramphoteric. It is estimated that 70 % of all separation methods for proteins\rinvolve IEC.\n\r Resource Tosoh\n"},{"id":218,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-03-HPLC-Columns/Column_selection_dB/","title":"HPLC Column Database","section":"Part 03 HPLC Columns","content":"Figure : \rColumn selection #   www.hplccolumns.org\n ACD/Column Selector\nMethod translation #   ACD/LC Method Translator\nCorss Reference #   Agilent vs. Grace\nSoftware #   Marvin\u0026rsquo;s Drawing of chemical compounds\n Chemicalize\n"},{"id":219,"href":"/docs/20-Separation-Science/Part-1-Theory/Hydrophilic-Lipophilic_Balance/","title":"Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance","section":"Part 01 Theory","content":"Figure : \rThe hydrophilic-lipophilic balance is a measure of the degree to which it is hydrophilic or lipophilic (or hydrophobic), determined by calculating values for the different regions of the molecule, as described by Griffin in 1949 and 1954.

MassBank was the first mass spectra database of small chemical compounds for life sciences (\u0026lt;3000 Da) (MassBank, 2016). This repository was designed to share the obtained mass spectral data among the scientific community (Horai et al., 2010, p. 703). Thus, MassBank data could be useful for the chemical identification and structure elucidation of chemical compounds detected by mass spectrometry. Among other features, MassBank supplies (1) tandem mass spectra acquired on broad range of mass spectrometers as well as different ion sources; (2) a friendly interface, which could be used to find mass spectrum by chemical name or molecular formula; and (3) an easy way to search similar spectra on a neutral loss-to-neutral loss basis.\nChemspider. ChemSpider is a free online service that delivers information of more than 57 million structures from hundreds of data sources (Chemspider, 2016). These sources include data from government databases, commercial chemical supplier catalogs, academic and commercial website. Thus, it could be considered as the richest single source of structure-based chemistry information. For identification purposes, ChemSpider is useful to obtain MS and MS/MS spectra from known compounds. The spectra can only be found by systematic name, trade name, SMILES, InChI, or CSID. However, it is not possible to obtain information of compounds, which have not been partially identified before.\nMETLIN Metabolomics Database. This web-based database has been developed by the Scripps Research Institute (California, USA) (METLIN, 2016). This database is designed to provide, among others, structural and physical data on known endogenous metabolites, drugs, and pesticides and their metabolites and high-accuracy mass spectrum data from known compounds and their derivatives (Smith et al., 2005, p. 747). In addition, a wide MS/MS spectra collection has been developed. This information has been obtained on an Agilent 6510 Q-TOF instrument by collecting compound-specific reference spectra at three different CEs. The mass spectrometer is operated in both ESI positive and negative modes. Currently, there are more than 700,000 high-resolution MS/MS spectra available. It should be noted that this number is continuously expanding.\nA new database namely isoMETLIN has been developed through METLIN (Cho et al., 2014, p. 9358; IsoMETLIN, 2016). This database could facilitate the identification of metabolites that have been isotopically labeled. Thus, in the field of pesticide analysis it could be a powerful tool, as the number of isotope labeled species is gradually increasing. This database allows to search all computed isotopologues derived from METLIN on the basis of m/z values and specified isotopes of interest, such as 13C or 15N. In addition, isoMETLIN provides experimental MS/ MS data on hundreds of isotopomers.\nThe Spectral Data Base for Organic Compounds. The Spectral Data Base for Organic Compounds (SDBS) (2016) is a free online site developed by National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan. SBDS contains six different types of organic compounds including an electron impact mass spectrum (EI-MS), a Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR), a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, a 13C NMR spectrum, a laser Raman spectrum, and an electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum. This database has more than 25,000 MS spectra, which were obtained by the electron impact method.\nHuman Metabolome Database. The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is an online database of small molecule metabolites found in the human body. This freely available electronic database contains detailed information about 42,000 small molecule metabolites. The project has been developed by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Alberta InnovatesdHealth Solutions, and by The Metabolomics Innovation Centre (Human Metabolome Database, 2016). This database was designed to give helpful information about (1) chemical data, (2) clinical data, and (3) molecular biology/biochemistry data. In the field of mass spectrometry, to identify or characterize human metabolites, HMDB allows to query NMR spectroscopy, GC MS spectrometry and LC/MS spectrometry data. In fact, HMDB includes nearly 10,000 NMR, GC MS, and LC/MS spectra. Additionally, there are other databases related to HMDB including Urine Metabolome, DrugBank, Toxin and Toxin Target Database (T3DB), Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB), and Food Database (FooDB). The HMDB provides information about 3100 small molecule metabolites found in human urine (Urine Metabolome Database, 2016). Up to date, the DrugBank database (Drugbank, 2016) helps to get information about more than 8200 drug and drug metabolites. T3DB (Toxin and Toxin Target Database, 2016) contains information on 3673 toxins such as pollutants, pesticides, drugs, and food toxins. SMPDB (Small Molecule Pathway Database, 2016) has more than 618 pathway diagrams. FooDB is the most recent database in HMDB site (Food Database, 2016). This database contains information on 28,000 food components and food additives. Among others, FooDB allows to obtain data on (1) MS and MS/MS spectra, (2) nomenclature, and (3) concentrations in various foods.\nFiehn Library. This database has been developed by West Coast Metabolomics Center (California, USA) (Kind et al., 2009, p. 10,038). The library has been developed using several mass spectrometers including TOF or single quadrupole using electron impact ionization. Currently, this database contains over 1000 identified metabolites. MS spectra along with retention time allow to obtain a comprehensive metabolic profiling.\nmz Cloud. mz cloud is a free database, which contains information on 6000 compounds and more than 1,518,041 high-resolution MS/MS spectra (m/z Cloud Database, 2016). This spectra information is shown to the user with spectral trees. Thus, the users could find the information in a more intuitive way. Most data displayed have been collected with Thermo mass spectrometers. MS/MS and multistage MSn spectra were acquired at different CEs, precursor m/z, and isolation widths using CID and HCD. mz Cloud provides information about (1) the chemical structure, (2) computationally and manually annotated fragments (peaks), (3) identified adducts and multiply charged ions, and (4) molecular formulas, predicted precursor structure. Additionally, mz cloud will allow registered users to create individual, public, or private spectral libraries increasing the laboratory workflow.\nA summary of mz cloud interface work is illustrated in Fig. 2.16, on the search of MS-spectra information of dopamine. First of all, the user should indicate the compound name (Fig. 2.16A). In this section, additional complementary information for instance related to the mass spectrometer and ionization mode used is available. Then, the user can select the different MSn spectra available in the spectral tree (Fig. 2.16B). Finally, parameter such as CID or HCD applied in the selected MSn spectrum could be checked.\nThe following databases are not readily available. However, because of their wide use and acceptance by scientific community it is worthwhile mentioning them. These databases are the Wiley Registry MS/MS and the NIST MS/MS database.\nThe Wiley Registry MS/MS. This MS/MS spectral library includes nearly 775,500 MS/MS spectra and 741,000 chemical structures. Thus, sensitive, specific, and robust identification of small molecules such as illicit drugs, pharmaceutical compounds, pesticides, and other small bioorganic molecules could be carried out (Oberacher, 2013, p. 312). These MS/MS spectra were obtained with different high-resolution mass spectrometers (Q-TOF) employing positive or negative ESI at least at 10 different CEs (Wiley, 2016). Its full potential has been checked in several cross-validation studies using sample spectra extracted from tandem mass spectral libraries from literature and acquired on various types of tandem mass spectrometers (Oberacher, Whitley, \u0026amp; Berger, 2013, p. 487).\nThe NIST MS/MS database. This database was developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Maryland, USA). NIST MS/MS database, which is widely used for scientific community, is supplied by John Wiley and Sons (NIST Standard Reference Database, 2016). The aim of this library is to provide reference mass spectral data for the identification of compounds through the fragmentation of their ions generated by ESI. MS spectra were obtained using several types of mass spectrometers, including low- and high-resolution mass spectrometers, including ion trap, QqQ, and Q-TOF. ESI electronic impact ionization has been employed. NIST MS/MS database currently provides more than 193,119 and 41,165 MS/MS spectra of small molecules and biologically active peptides, respectively (NIST Standard Reference Database, 2016).\np44-49, Applications in High Resolution Mass Spectrometrey Food Safety and Pesticide Residue Analysis, edited by Roberto Romero-González, ©2017 ELSEVIER.\n"},{"id":226,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-07-Application/Mobile_phase_conditions/","title":"Mobile Phase Conditions","section":"Part 07 Application","content":"To talk about mobile phase.\nMichael W. Dong, HPLC and UHPLC For Practicing Scientists, 2nd Edition, P255 #  Mobile Phase Parameters (%B, pH, Buffer, Solvent Type) In HPLC, the mobile phase controls the retention and selectivity of the separation for a given stationary phase and can be conveniently and continuously adjusted during method improvement. Lowering the solvent strength (%B of the strong solvent) increases retention and typically increases resolution in isocratic separations (see Figure 2.15). The effect of pH, buffer concentration, and organic solvent type for analyte retention on selectivity is described in Section 2.3.6. Furthermore, the influence of these parameters on fine-tuning selectivity is illustrated in the following case studies.\nDr. Egidijus Machtejevas, Analytix Report, Issue 10, 2021, p35 #  The most important part of a chromatographic set up is the column. But even though it provides retention, the final separation also depends strongly on the mobile phase (MP). The various effects offered by the mobile phase influence the retention and differential migration (selectivity) of the solutes through the column. Therefore, during method development and optimization, the separation might have to be tuned by changing mobile phase parameters, such as solvent type, additives (different buffers, ion pair reagents), or operating conditions (gradient time/ steepness, temperature, flow rate). Often, problems with chromatographic separation are related to an incorrectly/inconsistently prepared mobile phase. Hence, an inclination to use simpler mobile phases can be observed for practical reasons of increased method robustness, easier method transfer, and ease of use (e.g. in clinical diagnostics or in process control).\nSolvent/Mobile Phase Additive Purity Most of you are familiar with the rule: “garbage in, garbage out.” This adage is especially true when selecting the correct purity of mobile phase components. For example, it is an absolute must to use gradient grade solvents \u0026amp; reagents for gradient grade separations to get an accurate, reproducible and clean baseline (free of ghost peaks), and sensitive chromatographic separation (see also HPLC Tips and Tricks in Analytix Reporter 9 \u0026ldquo;Increase Your HPLC/UHPLC Method Sensitivity“). Using the correct and suitable grade of solvents based on the application (e.g. hypergrade for LC-MS for LC-MS methods, see more at SigmaAldrich.com/Solvents) also minimizes the chances of contaminations and extends the longevity of a chromatographic column. For cases requiring addition of any reagent like buffer, it is to be ensured that the reagent meets the required quality and has not passed its expiry date. The degradants from expired additives lead to ghost peaks in sample chromatograms. Certain additives degrade quicker, depending on their nature (for example 20 mM, pH 7 phosphate buffer). Improper/careless handling (for example left over solvent put back into bottle, bottle left on the lab bench without the cap closed, lost pipette tips floating inside the bottle and so on) of these reagents spoil chemicals quickly.\nMixing Mobile Phases\nFor isocratic separations with premixed mobile phases, solvent volumetric contractions in commonly used mixtures (water/acetonitrile, methanol or tetrahydrofuran) should be taken into account during their preparation. The only correct way to prepare such mobile phase mixtures is to separately take precisely measured volumes of the components and mix them. For example, to get a 70% organic mobile phase, 300 mL of water and 700 mL of organic solvent should be precisely measured separately and then combined together in a flask. But if only the water is measured precisely and the organic solvent is then added to make up the required final volume, due to the solvent mixture contraction, the resulting solvent strength will be a little higher (or weaker in case organic solvent was added first and water was added later). For premixing of MPs, attention should be taken to the toxic solvent fumes that might be emitted, under a fume hood.\nNowadays, gradients are generally correctly formulated using gradient pumps; however, some minor differences in retention behavior might be observed during comparison of the instruments with low-pressure and high-pressure gradient systems due to their mixing mechanisms.\nPersonally, in Reversed-Phase chromatography, I prefer HPLC methods with premixed mobile phases such as 5% acetonitrile in water and/or 5% water in acetonitrile. The rationale behind such preference is to increase degassing effectiveness, avoid mixture heating (e.g. methanol in water) or cooling (e.g. acetonitrile in water) upon mixing, and also to improve mixing efficiency by making the two mobile phases more similar in viscosity and surface tension. The limitations of such premixed solvents are that solvent strength of mobile phase B cannot be 100% and an extra step in mobile phase preparation – which is an additional, potential source of error. Typically, it is recommended to use mobile phase solvents directly out of their delivery containers to prevent additional chances of contamination.\nThe final step in the mobile phase preparation is filtration. There are many different types of filters that could be chosen based on the solvents being filtered. Recommended are membrane-type filters with pore sizes of at least 0.45 µm for HPLC systems, and 0.22 µm for UHPLC systems. Filtering removes particles from the prepared mobile phase and prevents clogging of the system and column.\nTo be continued in the next HPLC Tips \u0026amp; Tricks discussing mobile phase pH and buffer preparation issues.\nIn case you have any chromatography trouble, please contact us at Analytix@milliporesigma.com\n"},{"id":227,"href":"/docs/94-Database/Part-03-Mobile-Phase/Mobile_phase-pH/","title":"Mobile Phase pH","section":"Part 03 Mobile Phase","content":"Figure : \rTable 1 : Variation of the pH of aqueous buffers at overall concentration 0.01 mol dm−3 with the addition of organic modifiers\r[Source: M.

We want to adjust pH to promote the charged state of the analyte in the electrospray ionization mode. The concentration of the buffer, or acid or base used to adjust/control the pH, should be as low as possible for ES. Ammonium acetate and ammonium formate are generally applicable at pH 7 but concentrations should be kept to a minimum. \u0026hellip;  Optimization of the Selection of Mobile Phase #  The selection of mobile phase is important to obtain a good chromatographic separation, but it also affects the analyte ionization and the sensitivity of the mass spectrometer. For example, analyte charge should be suppressed by manipulation of the mobile-phase pH for optimum retention but this can have a detrimental affect on MS response. Contrary to conditions for RP LC retention, for optimized electrospray (ES) ionization, the pH should be adjusted to promote the charged state of the analyte over its neutral species as ionization takes place in the liquid phase. In contrast, for optimized atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), in which ionization takes place in the gas phase, formation of the neutral species is favored due to the higher volatility of the neutral versus charged species and hence better vaporization. A compromise can be sought by experimentation but this is particularly difficult when a wide range of pesticides, with differing properties, have to be analyzed.\nThe situation is further complicated if polarity switching is employed so that positive and negative ions are periodically sampled throughout the analytical run. Alternatively, the target pesticides are divided into anionic and cationic groups and analysis performed separately. For routine application, even designs of orthogonal nebulizers for atmospheric pressure ionization interfaces are still restricted to the use of volatile buffers.\nThe concentration of the buffer, or acid or base used to adjust/control the pH, should be as low as possible for ES. If not, competition between analyte and electrolyte ions for conversion to gas-phase ions decreases the analyte response. If a species is in large excess, it will cover the droplet surface and prevent other ions to access the surface, and thus to evaporate. A species in large excess will also catch all charges available and prevent the ionization of other molecules present at much lower concentration.\nAmmonium acetate and ammonium formate are generally applicable at pH 7 but concentrations should be kept to a minimum.\nRP LC separations are sometimes improved at acidic pH, using acetic acid or formic acid, as such or in combination with ammonium acetate or ammonium formate.\nThe addition of reagents postcolumn can be used to generate pH conditions optimum for ionization without changing chromatographic separation but this approach is rarely implemented for routine analyses.\nMethanol and/or acetonitrile are used as organic modifiers. Low surface tension and a low dielectric constant of the solvent promote ion evaporation, which favor the ionization process.\nThe gas-phase basicity (proton affinity) and gas-phase acidity (electron affinity) are also important solvent properties in the positive and negative ionization modes, respectively. Those features encourage the use of methanol versus acetonitrile.\nMethanol is also preferred over acetonitrile when MS with ES is coupled to gradient LC because the lower eluotropic strength of methanol causes compounds to elute at a higher percentage of organic solvent, where ES sensitivity is increased. In most cases, more pesticides appear to elute in the middle of the analytical run.\nGiven the extra demand on MS acquisition in terms of obtaining sufficient data points across a peak and a long enough dwell time for sensitivity, it is surprising that few authors have reported efforts to optimize the gradient conditions so that pesticides exhibit a wider elution profile.\np76, Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples, CRC Press, 2008, edited by José L.

Increasing column temperatures (T) reduces retention and solvent viscosity in RPC and can have significant effects on selectivity. The gradient range (ΔΦ) of the strong solvent (typically %B) is defined as “final %B – initial %B” and is usually determined from the initial work using a broad gradient scouting analysis.\nA narrower gradient range is useful to increase the resolution of analytes around the main component. Gradient time ($t_G$) in conjunction with ΔΦ defines the gradient slope (ΔΦ/$t_G$). An increase in tG often increases the overall resolution of complex samples, as the peak capacity is roughly proportional to the square root of tG for broad linear gradients. Both T and $t_G$ can be continuously varied, and their combined change offers an exceptional opportunity for fine-tuning separations using retention modeling software programs (e.g. DryLab, LC Simulator, or ChromSword). For purity analysis of complex samples, a multiple-segment gradient approach is an effective strategy as shown in Section 10.4.3.\n"},{"id":232,"href":"/docs/94-Database/Part-01-Columns/","title":"Part 01 Columns","section":"DataBase","content":"This is the root of column section.\n"},{"id":233,"href":"/docs/94-Database/Part-02-Solvent/","title":"Part 02 Solvent Property","section":"DataBase","content":"It is about solvent properties.\n"},{"id":234,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-03-HPLC-Columns/","title":"Part 03 HPLC Columns","section":"HPLC","content":"It talks about HPLC Columns.\n"},{"id":235,"href":"/docs/94-Database/Part-03-Mobile-Phase/","title":"Part 03 Mobile Phase","section":"DataBase","content":"It is about template.\n"},{"id":236,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-04-GLP-for-HPLC/","title":"Part 04 Good Lab Practice for HPLC","section":"HPLC","content":"It is about template.\n"},{"id":237,"href":"/docs/94-Database/Part-04-MRM-Transition/","title":"Part 04 MRM Transitions","section":"DataBase","content":"It is about LC-MS/MS Transitions data.\n"},{"id":238,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-05-Method-Development/","title":"Part 05 Method Development","section":"HPLC","content":".\n"},{"id":239,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-06-Instrumentation-Troubleshooting/","title":"Part 06 Instrumentation Troubleshooting Guide in General","section":"HPLC","content":"The framework of this part is built on a Thermo Fisher Scientific guide on how to do troubleshooting.\n"},{"id":240,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-07-Application/","title":"Part 07 Application","section":"HPLC","content":"It talks about theory.\n"},{"id":241,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-08-Problems/","title":"Part 08 Problems","section":"HPLC","content":"It is about problems.\n"},{"id":242,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-01-Theory/","title":"Part I Theory","section":"HPLC","content":"It talks about theory.\n"},{"id":243,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-04-GLP-for-HPLC/Preventing_solving_hardware_problems/","title":"Preventing and solving common hardware problems","section":"Part 04 Good Lab Practice for HPLC","content":"Figure : \rPreventing Leaks\nLeaks are a common problem in HPLC analyses. To minimize leaks in your system, avoid interchanging hardware and fittings from different manufacturers. Incompatible fittings can be forced to fit initially, but the separation may show problems and repeated connections may eventually cause the fitting to leak. If interchanging is absolutely necessary, use appropriate adapters and check all connections for leaks before proceeding.\nHighly concentrated salts (\u0026gt;0.2 M) and caustic mobile phases can reduce pump seal efficiency. The lifetime of injector rotor seals also depends on mobile phase conditions, particularly operation at high pH. In some cases, prolonged use of ion pair reagents has a lubricating effect on pump pistons that may produce small leaks at the seal. Some seals do not perform well with certain solvents. Before using a pump under adverse conditions, read the instrument manufacturer’s specifications. To replace seals, refer to the maintenance section of the pump manual.\nUnclogging the Column Frit\nA clogged column frit is another common HPLC problem. To minimize this problem from the start, use a precolumn filter and guard column.\nTo clean the inlet, first disconnect and reverse the column. Connect it to the pump (but not to the detector), and pump solvent through at twice the standard flow rate. About 5-10 column volumes of solvent should be sufficient to dislodge small amounts of particulate material on the inlet frit. Evaluate the performance of the cleaned column using a standard test mixture.\nReplacing a Frit at the Column Inlet\nSometimes neither solvent flushing (see above) nor restoration procedures (Table 2) restore a column’s performance. If you’ve isolated the column as the problem source, and other restorative procedures have failed, a void in the packing or a persistent obstruction on the inlet frit may exist.\nAs a last resort, open the inlet end of the column. Caution: opening the inlet end, and more so opening the outlet end, can permanently damage the packing bed. Before opening columns, consult the manufacturer’s literature. (Never open either end of a resin-filled column).\nUse the following procedure to open a column.\n Disconnect the column from the system. To prevent the packing from oozing out of the column, perform subsequent steps as quickly as possible. Using a vise and wrench, or two wrenches, carefully remove the inlet end fitting (Figure D). If the frit remains in the fitting, dislodge it by tapping the fitting on a hard surface. If the frit stays on the column, slide it off rather than lift it off. This will help preserve the integrity of the packing bed.\nModular columns may require a special tool (e.g., Cat. No. 55216), to remove the frit cap. Examine the old frit. Compression of the frit against the stainless steel tubing will leave a ring around the edge on the column side of a properly seated frit. No ring can mean the ferrule is seated too near the tubing end. The resulting loose connection can leak silica or act as a mixing chamber. Examine the packing bed. If it is depressed or fractured, you need a new column. Replace the frit. Replace the end fitting. Screw it down fingertight, then tighten 1/4 turn with a wrench.   source\n"},{"id":244,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-08-Problems/Problems/","title":"Problems","section":"Part 08 Problems","content":"Figure : \rProblems to be followed LCMS degasser and tuning issue\n"},{"id":245,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-04-GLP-for-HPLC/Pump/","title":"Pump Maintenance","section":"Part 04 Good Lab Practice for HPLC","content":"Figure : \rSigma-Aldrich Guide #  The pump must deliver a constant flow of solvent to the column over a wide range of conditions.

Some of the more common symptoms are erratic retention times, noisy baselines, or spikes in the chromatogram. Leaks at pump fittings or seals will result in poor chromatography. A sure sign of a leak is a buildup of salts at a pump connection. Buffer salts should be flushed from the system daily with fresh deionized water. To isolate and repair specific problems related to your apparatus, use the troubleshooting and maintenance sections of the operation manual. Pump seals require periodic replacement. You should perform regular maintenance rather than waiting for a problem to occur.\n Source: Sigma-Aldrich\n"},{"id":246,"href":"/docs/02-Chrom-HPLC/Part-07-Application/Removal_Phospholipids/","title":"Removal of Phospholipids","section":"Part 07 Application","content":"On-line Cartridges HybrideSPE® #  by Hillel Brandes\nINTRODUCTION\nPhospholipids (PLs) are abundantly (at the mg/mL level) present in biological fluids such as: blood, plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluids, among others. PLs are often co-extracted with a broad range of analytes of interest during sample preparation. The phospholipids present in a sample are notorious for producing various issues in LC/MS-based bioanalysis. PLs may cause ion suppression or, in rarer cases, ion enhancement, during MS detection. They also tend to build up on a reversed-phase (e.g., C18 and C8) column, fouling the chromatographic separation and ultimately shortening the column lifetime.\nConsequently, the accuracy, reproducibility, and sensitivity of LC/MS bioanalyses may be greatly compromised if the PLs are not removed. HybridSPE® Phospholipid technology has been developed for selective and rapid depletion of phospholipids from biological samples prior to LC/MS analysis of small molecules. The technology utilizes the affinity of zirconia particles for selective binding and removal of phospholipids. The technology was introduced a few years ago in two product formats:\n96-well filter plates for high throughput sample preparation and individual cartridges for low throughput applications. Here a new product format, an on-line cartridge, is described as an alternative option of phospholipid removal and sample preparation. The setup of the on-line cartridges with a LC/MS column is devised and the efficiency for phospholipid removal from protein precipitated plasma samples has been evaluated. Applicability of the system was demonstrated with three sets of compounds with different physiochemical properties.\nTHREE SETS OF ANALYTES\nEXPERIMENTAL Materials Supel™ Genie HybridSPE® on-line cartridge (2 cm length x 4.0 mm i.d), Rat Plasma K2-EDTA (Lampire Cat. # 7306407); Protein precipitation solvent: Acetonitrile with 1% formic acid or methanol with 1% (w/v) ammonium formate.\nSample Processing Procedure: The rat plasma or rat plasma spiked with analytes was protein precipitated by vortex mixing the plasma samples with the precipitation solvent at a 1:3 ratio. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm x 3 min and the resulting supernatant was collected for LC/MS analysis.\nHYBRIDSPE®-LC/MS SETUP As shown in Figure 4, the setup consists of two pumps, one for HPLC separation, and the other for loading protein-crashed samples and washing the HybridSPE® on-line cartridges. A 50 µL tee is employed for mixing of sample loading mobile phase and the HPLC separation mobile phases. The 2-position switching valve allows for washing the cartridges once the samples are loaded onto the HPLC column.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Supel™ Genie HybridSPE® on-line cartridges are designed for removal of phospholipids from more than 100 injections of 1 µL of protein precipitated plasma samples. Figure 5(A) shows the phospholipids in the rat plasma, if not removed, give rise to two broad peaks of high intensity. The two peaks correspond to the phospholipids containing one and two fatty acyl chain(s), respectively. When the HybridSPE® on-line cartridge is set up with the LC/MS (Figure 4), no phospholipid peaks were detected, even at the 120th injection of the same rat plasmasample (Figure 5(B)). The results demonstrate the HybridSPE® cartridges are capable of elimination of the phospholipids from 120 consecutive injections of 1 µL of protein precipitated plasma samples.\nThe applicability of the HybridSPE® on-line cartridges has been demonstrated with three sets of analytes including basic and neutral classes. As can be seen from Figure 6-8, narrow and symmetric peaks were observed for all of the tested analytes with a peak width at half height \u0026lt;6 s and tailing factors 0.9-1.3, respectively. Table 4 summarizes the recoveries and reproducibilities of the target compounds using the on-line SPE method. For all of the tested analytes, recoveries of 94-102% were obtained and reproducibilities of 1-5% were achieved.\nSUMMARY An on-line cartridge for phospholipid removal with LC/MS analysis has been successfully developed. The performance testing demonstrates the on- line cartridges are capable of removing \u0026gt;95% of phospholipids from 1 µL of plasma samples even after 120 consecutive injections. Three applications have been established using on-line HybridSPE® with LC/MS detection. Recovery of the analytes is 94%- 102%, with a reproducibility of 1%-5%. For all of the tested analytes, narrow and symmetric peaks were observed, peak width at half height \u0026lt;6 s and tailing factors 0.9-1.3, respectively.\n"},{"id":247,"href":"/docs/03-Mass-Spec-GC-MS/Part-2-Application/Varian_GCMS_Spec/","title":"Spec sheet of Varian GC/MS @ AECL","section":"Part II","content":"Spec sheet of Varian GC/MS @ AECL\nInjector:\t1177 type\nColumn: CP-Select 624CB\nGC: 3800\nDetector: model 300 single-quadrupole MS.\nThe EI source consists of an ion volume, a filament assembly, electron collimating magnets, and ion focusing lenses, all supported by a heated ion block.

When this silanol ionized into Si-O(minus), it produces ionic retention mechanism where positive molecule species will be attracted and retain longer on the column bed (which is good basically). There some cases where the interaction of ionized silanol with some molecules especially pharmaceutical compound (they contain a lot of amine, NH2 group) is strong to an extent where this interaction produces a hideous tailing chromatogram peak. So, this is when the use of TEA is appropriate. TEA temporarily interact with ionized silanol group at higher affinity so that other compound cannot interact with that silanols. In other word, it protects or deactivates the silanol from interacting with your compounds. To totally inhibit silanol activity, 10 mM of TEA would be enough but i recommend that you optimized the amount of TEA (just enough to prevent peak tailing) to add an extra ionic retention mechanism on your column (not just reversed phase mechanism). If you dont want any silanol activity, just purchase end capped HPLC column where it deactivates silanol group by adding a permanent covalent alkyl linkage with that silanol (Si-O-R). With these column, TEA will not be needed.\n H. Zulhilmi    Triethylamin is a quaternary amine, which is positive charge. The \u0026ldquo;nonpolar\u0026rdquo; ethyl groups interacted with the nonpolar C18 groups of your colmn. Due to that the positive charged amine group, the surface of you nonpolar C18 column get more polar and your analyte can interact with his polar functionally groups.\n Matthias Balsam    If there is excessive TEA in the mobile phase, it begins to dissolve the silica. When silica dissolves, the bonded functional groups also leave. The result of this was an increase of the retention time of the analyte and a very significative effect on the tailling\u0026hellip;a very large tail appear after the elution of the compound.\n Anonymous    TEA is a basic compound. The excess amount of TEA changes the pH of the mobile phase. At basic condition, TEA exist in its neutral form. Neutral form of TEA will never interact with $SiO^-$. furthermore, at basic condition all silanol definitely will exist in its ionic form (all of them) which may cause longer peak retention on your case.\n H.

For me the most time consuming, costly, and frustrating is the leak. These things cause no end of problems in your GC-MS system. They will lower the sensitivity of the method, cause you to lose a lot of carrier gas, could damage your column, and damage the mass spectrometer source. You can get lucky and find them right away or they can take days to track down (the second is usually my luck). Many of these will be obvious but when you are the most upset they seem to be forgotten, unless that is only me but I’m guessing it’s not. GC GC-MS leak checking can be a little more difficult than on an LC. With an LC when there is a leak you get a puddle, there isn’t much puddling of carrier gas on a GC. Sometimes a leak on a GC-MS can be seen in the MS tune page, look for masses 18, 28, 32, 44 and their relative intensities.\nresource: https://analyteguru.com/gc-gc-ms-troubleshooting-part-i-top-6-tips-for-fixing-a-leak/#:~:text=%20GC%20GC-MS%20Troubleshooting%20Part%20I%3B%20Top%206,to%20connect%20columns%20together%20with%20press...%20More%20\nGhost Peaks    Possible Cause Solution     Contammination of the injector or column Clean the injector and liner.

HILIC column is similar to the normal phase HPLC column. But its water resistance is better.\nCommon HILIC columns include silica columns, NH2 columns, diol columns, amide columns. The stationary phase of pure silica columns is not easily lost. Amino columns, commonly used language carbohydrate (sugar) separation. Diol-based columns have good hydrophilicity and can provide different selectivity.\nWhat is the difference between HILIC columns and common HPLC columns?\nCompared with normal phase columns, HILIC columns can be used in aqueous/organic mobile phases. HILIC requires higher water-resistance of the stationary phase. Otherwise, problems such as high baseline noise and short column life will occur due to hydrolysis of the stationary phase.\nIn short, normal phase columns may not be used in HILIC chromatography. But HILIC columns can be used in normal phase chromatography.\nThe requests for the mobile phase with HILIC columns?\nIn most HILIC testings, the mobile phase used is a mixture containing a small amount of water/buffer with the organic phase (typically acetonitrile). The proportion of water is ranged from 3% to 40%.\nIt is generally believed that the water in the mobile phase of HILIC chromatography will be adsorbed to the surface of the polar stationary phase to form a water film. The analytes will be partitioned between the water film and the mobile phase. Together with the hydrogen bonding force between the polar functional groups and the stationary phase, and the electrostatic force between the ionic functional groups, the HILIC column can achieve the retention of the analytes. The role of aqueous membranes is very important, and the mobile phase contains at least 3% water. When the percentage of water is greater than 40%, the retention is generally very weak (k ≈ 0).\n"},{"id":262,"href":"/docs/95-Literature-Reading/BEH_application_steroids/","title":"BEH Column Application in Steroid Conjugates","section":"Literature Reading","content":"Separation of both glucuronide and sulfate steroids was successfully achieved on BEH and BEH 2-EP columns, but with relatively long run time (approximately 40 min; data not shown).

They were called pellicular particles at the beginning of their invention by Horvath. These particles are made of a solid silica core surrounded by a layer of porous silica with the intention to reduce the average diffusion paths of analytes across the particles. This type of particle was commercialized by Kirkland though the major breakthrough for modern LC was in 2007 when 2.7 μm superficially porous particles appeared on the market. These particles were made of a 1.7 μm solid silica core and covered with a 0.5 μm porous shell, also referred to as fused-core particles. Since then, sub-3 μm and sub-2 μm core\u0026ndash;shell particles have been commercially available from numerous manufacturers with slightly varying core to shell ratio. For instance, 2.6 μm Kinetex particles from Phenomenex consist of 1.9 μm solid core and a 0.35 μm porous silica layer.\nPro #  The exceptional efficiency of columns packed with core-shell particles is comparable with sub-2 μm fully porous particles, yet with much lower backpressure. This makes it practically useful for labs equipped only with conventional LC.\nThe high efficiency of core-shell columns lies mainly in the reduction of both the longitudinal diffusion B coefficient (-20 to -30%) and the eddy dispersion A term (\u0026ndash;0%).\nCons #  1) at ultra high pressure, the effect of frictional heating causing temperature gradients within the columns could be an issue.\n2) Meanwhile, the quality of column packing also plays a significant role for the performance of narrow bore columns. 3) The smaller the internal diameter of the column, the more critical the extra-column band broadening effects are. In other words, efficiency of columns of 3 mm inner diameter would be less affected by extra-column volume than the narrow bore columns. For Cortecs columns (Waters) of 1.6 m particles, 2.1 mm inner diameter were chosen as they have the same dimension as the fully porous BEH C18, 1.7 μm column (100 × 2.1 mm, tested for comparison).\nConsequence, different core-shell columns could affect technology transfer aspects of methods.\nList of Core-shell C_18 Columns #  Table 1: Core-shell columns tested\rColumn Characterization Protocols #   PQRI methodology; NIST SRM 870 test; Modified Tanaka test;  Tanaka test assesses selectivity and performance differences between LC columns.\nA set of seven selected substances is used to describe retention factor, hydrophobicity, steric selectivity, and silanophilic properties.\nGood batch to batch reproducibility of columns are extremely important to develop a robust method for pharmaceutical analysis. Four selected active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are selected to gain the insight of the batch-to-batch reproducibility of studied core\u0026ndash;shell columns. For this test, not only retention factor, but also column efficiency and peak shape of these four APIs are compared for different batches of the same type column. The selected APIs are more representative for the real-life applications than Tanaka test probes. Hence Tanaka protocols were not used for the batch to batch reproducibility test in this study.\nFour API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) #  Table 2: Structure and relevant pka value of four API\r   Compound Structure pKa     Metoprolol  9.43   Omeprazole  4.27 and 8.76   Amlodipine  8.97   Felodipine  NA    Tanaka Test Results #  Table 3: Tanaka test results and column back pressure\rConclusion #   Kinetex EVO columns have lower retention factors for pentylbenzene and shape selectivity. Cortecs C18+ distinguish themselves in the high values (lilac) of $\\alpha_{C/P}$ and $\\alpha_{B/P}$ pH 2.7, which indicates the high acidic silanol activity of this stationary phase and low degree of end capping. This is surprising since Cortecs C18+ is claimed to have the same chemistry as CSH (charged surface hybrid) columns with permanent surface charge. Poroshell 120 Bonus-PR column is an outlier on the score plot, which is as expected as it is a non-C18 stationary phase. It is a combination of denselyreacted sterically-protected, diisopropyl-C14 groups covalently bonded through an embedded amide functionality to a silica support. Poroshell EC-C18, 2.7 μm, Kinetex C18 2.6 μm and Cortecs C18 1.6 μm showed the best batch-to-batch reproducibility. Core–shell columns in dimensions of 100×3 mm and of particles 2.6 to 2.7 μm tested in this study do have better or at least the same efficiency compared with fully porous BEH C18, 1.7 μm column, while the backpressure is much lower.

It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to get the most out of LC-MS/MS separations, and everyone in here is doing LC-MS/MS? Show of hands. Okay, good, good. I could have been bad. It could have been a very long night for all of you guys.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and cover is, I guess what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned over the course of what I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing. In my professional career, when I started making methods in 1994, the approach that was taken when there was no mass spectrometry, or as it is today, was very different. It really changes the game of chromatography. And what I\u0026rsquo;d like to do is kind of walk through really just an outline of how to utilize chromatography to make the mass spec work better. I\u0026rsquo;ve, I\u0026rsquo;ve done some seminars with Shimadzu. In the past, we do a few a year, I handle the chromatography side, they handle the mass spec side. And we always get into debates. What\u0026rsquo;s more important mass spec or chromatography? And we really found it to be pretty simple. The mass spec is $400,000, and the column is $400. So mass spec wins.\nPresentation Objectives So what I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about is really how do we define what\u0026rsquo;s needed for mass spectrometry? Because I look at it, the columns and the chromatography and the sample preparation, we do feeds that. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to cover that. We\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about what I like to call the physical stuff options for column formats, what works really well, because that\u0026rsquo;s really the first choice you make when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to determine what type of method to run. And then I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about what I like to call the chemical stuff, options for column chemistry. How do we choose the phase? And more importantly, how do we adjust the mobile phases that are needed to make mass spec work better, because really, what it comes down to is you got to feed the mass spec with something good, and you get some good results. So that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to cover. I glossed over slide real quick, I\u0026rsquo;m going to cover it. I\u0026rsquo;m from Restek. We are located our our headquarters is in Happy Valley, Pennsylvania. Actually, we\u0026rsquo;re talking to a customer today. And I think we refer to it as Silicon Valley. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of chromatography companies in this little valley. So that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m at. We are an employee owned company. And we work exclusively in chromatography. So about 12 years ago, the employees bought the company off of the original owner, and we\u0026rsquo;re maintaining an employee ownership today. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t know who Restek is, that\u0026rsquo;s, I guess who we are in a nutshell. So let\u0026rsquo;s get into the actual meat of the presentation. Let\u0026rsquo;s cover first what do we need from chromatography when it\u0026rsquo;s coupled to a mass spectrometer? And I really think that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at, to kind of sum it up. And this was our discussion with Shimadzu that I would have over and over again. Here\u0026rsquo;s how here\u0026rsquo;s how chromatography mass spectrometry see the world.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how the chromatography sees it. Heavy LC a little bit of MSMS mass spec is a detector for my separation. And that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s how chromatography is look at it. How a mass spectrometers mass spectrometry sees it. Little LC heavy MSM at the column is a filter for my mass back. Right? That\u0026rsquo;s really how they look at it. But really what it is, and I think how we should see it is chromatography makes the mass spec perform better. And that\u0026rsquo;s really what it\u0026rsquo;s about. Can chromatography feed the mass spec? And how do we create the good food that the mass spec needs. And that\u0026rsquo;s really what I\u0026rsquo;d like to cover. So if we just look at our process is very simple, right? We have sample preparation, and light separation and, and light detection. And really, each step makes the ladder work better. And if we do a very poor job of sample preparation, then the separation becomes very difficult. So if we can do a good job here, and a good job here that feeds detection, I think that\u0026rsquo;s how we make the mass spec work better. So what I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about for this talk is how do we use? How do we utilize chromatography, this section right here? How do we make that work better? So if we think about what mass spec needs, right? Removal and or separation of matrix ion suppression, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about that in a little bit. That\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s one of our major components for anytime we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a mass spec, we need high peak capacity, right? We don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily want complete resolution. But what we need is very high peak capacity. We want to cram as many peaks into a minute as we possibly can, right? Let\u0026rsquo;s let the mass spec do its job. We want symmetrical peaks at low mass on column. So this is probably this is one of the tricks that I learned early on in chromatography. If you want to make your peak look good, inject more. Right? It makes the peak look really nice. All those active sites, fill it up with analyte and my percentages go up by Peak looks good. But when we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with mass spec, we\u0026rsquo;re really dealing with very low on column masses of analytes. So we really want something that\u0026rsquo;s going to work at that low on column percentages. We want consistent retention for MRM transitions, nothing is worse than having a peak shift out of an MRM window. It\u0026rsquo;s just way too laborious. So really, what we want, in my opinion, is we want to remove and separate we want a lot of peaks crammed in there, we want good peak shape. Overall sensitivity is ultimately the the result of how efficient and symmetrical are Pixar. Lastly, which we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about a lot is compatibility with unlimited mobile face choice. That\u0026rsquo;s probably the biggest driver that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in what\u0026rsquo;s changing the way that we approach method development from my first time in 1994, with an HPLC. And what we\u0026rsquo;re seeing today with LC, MS. MS, the options for mobile phase just aren\u0026rsquo;t there, we have to have volatile components. We really don\u0026rsquo;t want to add too much, we can\u0026rsquo;t get anything too fancy. So the hardest part, in my opinion, is this part right here. How do we find mobile phases and stationary phase, they\u0026rsquo;re gonna give good chromatography, and really feed us with what we need. So I look at it this way. That was the instrument I started on in 1994. And where I made my first method and how that method worked, it was step one and step two, step one, open up the lab drawer and grab a call, because it really didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. Grab any old C 18, stick it on the instrument, and then spend a long time adjusting our mobile phase until we get what we want. So it was really laborious in this stage, right? Grab something, put it on and get what you want. Or we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with our cmsms. What, what I\u0026rsquo;d like to work on today, it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s a different thing entirely, we\u0026rsquo;re actually starting step one is the mobile phase. What gives me the highest sensitivity, and especially in matrix, that\u0026rsquo;s really where we\u0026rsquo;re starting. So we\u0026rsquo;re kind of reversing how method development occurs. And the last thing we do is find a column that works. So I think, um, from a column manufacturer standpoint, I like mass spec, because it puts a lot more onus an emphasis on the, on the column portion of it, and how can we choose the right columns that work under those conditions, but with a simplified mobile face selection, so that\u0026rsquo;s really what I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about in this in this presentation. And when I\u0026rsquo;m mean, feed the mass back, I think there\u0026rsquo;s a very important thing to look at, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk exclusively about electrospray ionization, it seems to be the most prominently used, and honestly, with the sources today, and the ability to switch from positive to negative. So quickly, we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a lot of work being done on electrospray. And in the process is actually relatively straightforward. John Fen, great job and coming up with it. But the process is really, it\u0026rsquo;s very straightforward. It happens, what I like to call dig. So this is what I always remind myself when I\u0026rsquo;m trying to make ions to D solve a ionizing guide. And that\u0026rsquo;s really what the interface does. It takes a liquid that\u0026rsquo;s coming from our LC takes it into a small capillary, and then it it applies gas overtop of it. And the way that I like to describe this when I give educational seminars is, it\u0026rsquo;s a spit take, does anyone know to spit take is, Do you ever watch like a bad comedy, where someone takes a drink, and then they go, and they spray it out? That\u0026rsquo;s what that that\u0026rsquo;s what the interface is doing? It\u0026rsquo;s creating these tiny little droplets. And those little droplets go through the process of de solvate ionizing guide. Why am I talking about these droplets, because as they start to produce the ions, right, you have charges, and let\u0026rsquo;s say they\u0026rsquo;re the same charge. And as that droplet starts to shrink, right, it\u0026rsquo;s D solvating. So it\u0026rsquo;s getting smaller, and those charges are coming closer together. When two charges of the same charge come together, they want to pull apart, so you get this little bit of repulsion. Ultimately, you end up with your ions in a gaseous phase. And that\u0026rsquo;s really what we want. And now we can move them into the mass spectrometer. So we dissolve eight, we ionize and we guide. If you think about the importance of chromatography, it really comes down to this. What\u0026rsquo;s in that droplet? If there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff in that droplet, it could compete for that charge that\u0026rsquo;s available inside that droplet. So when I say feed the mass spectrometer, this is really what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. We want to give it something that is ionizable. It dissipates very, very quickly. Sita nitro trial versus water, two different levels of the ionization. If we\u0026rsquo;ve got matrix in there, right, we didn\u0026rsquo;t do a good job with sample preparation. And as that stuff is coming through, it\u0026rsquo;ll take some of that charge, it\u0026rsquo;s called ionization suppression. So we\u0026rsquo;re really trying to do is get high peak capacity. So the mass spec can do its job, feed it with a good mobile phase something that it likes something that produces high ionization or, or yields good ionization. And most importantly, gives us selectivity where it\u0026rsquo;s needed cases like isobars, or two compounds that might compete for that charge. So when we look at the role of chromatography, it\u0026rsquo;s really what I like to call what we produce sensitivity with, we really have to balance flow. There\u0026rsquo;s optimal desolvation efficiencies, sources like certain amounts, and depending on the instrumentation, that flow could vary, we typically want a gradient elution. That\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about in the column section about the van director equation, or what I like to call the over use of the van Diem equation, we\u0026rsquo;re really going to use gradients, we want to try and compress that time as much as possible. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to be changing the percentage or the overall overall composition of it. We want high efficiency and peak capacity coming from that. So we really want high flow, right, and we want enough flow in a gradient, so we can compress that time down very quickly. I came prior to working at Restek, as I like to call one had a real job. I would we I worked for a CRO and time was money, you wanted to make the fastest, you want to make the fastest method possible. So that\u0026rsquo;s all that stuff is very important. We also have to consider any interferences as I talked about ion suppression charge competition, any isobaric separations we need. That\u0026rsquo;s the one point where selectivity is needed in chromatography. If we have two isobars, and the mass spec can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference, then we\u0026rsquo;re going to need something to separate those. We also want to look at mobile phase composition, high volatility, pah optimized for sensitivity, not necessarily for separation. And that\u0026rsquo;s a that\u0026rsquo;s, in my opinion, is a key component. When I think back to the my early days of working on an LC with a CA team, pH was one of the major things that I changed. That\u0026rsquo;s how I controlled my separation. With mass spec, we don\u0026rsquo;t really have that much of an option anymore. I look at pH as what we need for sensitivity, certain compounds in ESI, like a very low pH condition, because the droplet has very low tension at that point, the surface tension is low. And it does it the solvents very efficiently. Some nonpolar compounds need a high pH, they tend to ionize better under those conditions. So we\u0026rsquo;re really looking at not changing pH for selectivity, just for sensitivity, and a very few amendable modifiers. So I look at this as really what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to produce from chromatography, we need the proper flow, limit interference and get the right mobile phase composition to feed the mass spec. The reason why I\u0026rsquo;m bringing this up is because that is a completely different shift of thinking from when I started in 1994. It was very different. So what I\u0026rsquo;d like to walk through is how we can make an LC separation that\u0026rsquo;s going to give us that and feed what the mass spec is looking for. So I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna check real quick. Are we is everybody awake? We\u0026rsquo;re good? Yeah, okay, good. How\u0026rsquo;s the pace too slow, too fast. I was talking with someone at at dinner. I\u0026rsquo;m from Western Pennsylvania. So um, this is really slow talking for me. So if, if, if it\u0026rsquo;s too fast, please let me know. bases. Good. Good. Okay. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with where the LC separation works. And somebody keep track of time for me too. I can, I can get stuck with this. Come on, you can do it. Okay. The LC separation, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to spend a lot of time talking on this. I just want to kind of mention very quickly a schematic of how the process works. There\u0026rsquo;s really it\u0026rsquo;s a multi step process. It\u0026rsquo;s much more complex than this, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to give the overall basis for what we are trying to achieve from our chromatography. So it starts off with bulk mass transport, goes to pore diffusion, film mass transport, and then the interaction step. We\u0026rsquo;re going to spend some time on this at the end. I think that\u0026rsquo;s very important. How do the phases actually interact? So a picture says 1000 words, we have a mobile phase. We have bulk mass transport, we inject into that with our six port valve, we get this nice sample that\u0026rsquo;s flowing in our mobile phase. From there, we go into the pores of the, of the, of the particles inside the column. So we saw we have poor diffusion and lights move in. That\u0026rsquo;s a very important part of chromatography. They\u0026rsquo;re nerf balls, the silica particles are nerf balls, not oranges. So you\u0026rsquo;re actually flowing through them. So they analytes and really everything starts starts this process of pore diffusion. As it goes inside, I like to look at an LC column as a really, really good radiator or filter. What does the radiator in a car do? Does do, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s late at an early morning flight. We it takes the water right, and it spreads it out into these very small channels and the air flows over and it cools it, and then it takes it back in and it keeps that process moving, hot goes in, goes out cold goes in, and it keeps that going. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what the LC column is doing. We\u0026rsquo;ve got angstrom level pores, where we\u0026rsquo;re taking all of this mobile phase with the analytes in it and moving it into these very small channels. As a result, the surface difference is much, much smaller, our analytes have a chance to do what\u0026rsquo;s called filled mass transport, or pass into the stagnant liquid layer that\u0026rsquo;s that stands on those particles. That\u0026rsquo;s our face, our ca P or phenol or cyano. And we do Lastly, what\u0026rsquo;s called the interaction step where those analytes bind or interact with what\u0026rsquo;s on that stationary phase. So when it comes to LC columns, the first thing we look at is the physical stuff. How do we create high efficiency, high peak capacity? What works really well for what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do? And then we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about this the chemical stuff, what phases work really well? And then how do we control them? Because ultimately, it\u0026rsquo;s about creating this retention, which could drive selectivity. So when we look at chromatography, all of it still applies. The efficiency is really what I like to call the molecular distribution, a peak is just a mathematical distribution of analytes. Right? It\u0026rsquo;s a Gaussian distribution, how wide they are, and how tall they are, is the efficiencies that distribution retention is how much solubility they have in our stationary phase. If something is retained longer, it likes the stationary phase over the mobile. And the selectivity is the difference between the solubility of those molecules. And that\u0026rsquo;s really the simplified way that we look at chromatography, what it means for mass spec, what we need high efficiency, retention for matrix using a gradient elution and selectivity from isobars and interferences. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to cover in this section. How can you use chromatography to make that not any type of column any type of mobile phase? Let\u0026rsquo;s try and limit it to very specific mass spec. So how do we choose the best column parameters? What I like to call the physical stuff? If anyone\u0026rsquo;s ever has anyone ever opened up a column? Open up the top? Yeah. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t, don\u0026rsquo;t, unless it\u0026rsquo;s our column, then do it. Because chances are, it\u0026rsquo;s not going back together again. But if you ever open it up what it what a column is comprised of, it\u0026rsquo;s a very finely polished stainless steel tube, right? That\u0026rsquo;s really what it is with an end fitting that is either compressed on or mostly now threaded onto it. In there, we have a fret. And what this does is two things. One, it keeps the silica inside. And the second thing that it does is it stops matrix or, or particulates from getting into the column. Right? So really, we have this stainless steel housing, we have a bunch of silica balls that are contained in there with an average particle diameter that contain a pore volume, of which inside we have a stationary phase. So this is really the components. We\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about how do we take these components and make the right choices for mass spec? So just so we can understand what is the column, this is the column. And in actuality, it\u0026rsquo;s only if you look at the porosity of silica and what\u0026rsquo;s inside there. It\u0026rsquo;s only about 35%, silica 65%, empty. So we\u0026rsquo;re really ripping you off. When you think about it, we\u0026rsquo;re charging a full price for 35% of the call. So what are these things do, I\u0026rsquo;m going to walk through this relatively quickly, because I think the most important thing we talk about is really the chemical stuff, but just to kind of cover it very quickly. We have what I like to call the physical stuff or the parameters, and then what that does and how we control it. So our pore volume is really related to analyte size, a poor volume 300 angstrom, was about as high as you\u0026rsquo;re gonna get for a silica particle, right and much wider. And the basic rule that I\u0026rsquo;ve been told is it\u0026rsquo;s the poor has to be 10 times the size of the analyte or you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing chromatography. So anytime we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with proteins or sometimes peptides, any larger molecules, we look at for volume. particle diameter has a huge impact on flow, pressure, efficiency and retention. Particle tight Again, the same thing, you can see where the particle contribution is right here. This is really what it creates the internal diameter, the greatest impact that it has is really on the flow. If we want to try and limit the amount of flow, we take the tube and we make it smaller, right? That\u0026rsquo;s really what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. Column Link has a huge impact on efficiency, or what I like to call peak capacity, some pressure, obviously, it\u0026rsquo;s twice as long. And, and retention stationary phase is going to affect efficiency, retention and selectivity. So most people say it\u0026rsquo;s retention and selectivity, right? It\u0026rsquo;s the solutes. And how they interact. I\u0026rsquo;ve also found that has a large impact on efficiency as well, how well it transfers between those phases, impacts its peak shape. So if we take a look at all of this, this is really what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to control. And here\u0026rsquo;s the overall impact that it has on chromatography. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to walk through a couple options starting at the particle diameter. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you all have heard of UHPLC, or UPLC, right? increasing speed. Has anyone heard of fused core products or core shell or SPP superficially, porous particles, this is really a diagram of what we have here. It\u0026rsquo;s a very simple concept, efficiency increases as particle particle diameter lowers, and in pressure increases as well. So we have these two exponential curves. What we\u0026rsquo;re really doing here is if we take and compare a fully porous particle with an SPP, or fused core type particle, what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at is the diffusion path through the particle, that\u0026rsquo;s really what creates our efficiency. A smaller diffusion path means we have higher efficiency. So we want smaller diffusion pass, right? What the fuse core particles do is they, they lower the diffusion path, but with a nominal particle diameter. So if we look at particle diameter, impacts pressure, and efficiency, these types of particles are a way to get higher efficiencies without the back pressure that you would typically get from UHPLC. So really, we have three options, and which ones we choose are really going to be related to what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve. What are we trying to do? I have my personal favorite, but it\u0026rsquo;s only my personal opinion. And I can show you why, what what I believe on that. So the van der equation, this is what I like to call the real handyman equation. So we see this a lot, right. And plate height is has has three major contributions, any diffusion, longitudinal diffusion, and mass transfer. But if you break this down, this is what I think is really important. We have a choice of particle diameter, we can choose fully porous, different sizes, fused core type particles of different sizes. And we see a lot of text and research on van diem for linear velocities and what\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s optimal efficiencies. But I want to point out something I think is very significant for mass spectrometry. These terms are impacted by gradients. And they\u0026rsquo;re impacted by flow rates as well. So when we start to think about the van Diem equation, that works really, really well, if we\u0026rsquo;re using an isocratic separation, I think it\u0026rsquo;s pinpoint. But when we change to a gradient elution we are impacting these terms considerably. So gradients, change what is necessary in terms of flow and what is necessary in terms of what we think about the van demerger. So, if we think about that, if we got a gradient, that\u0026rsquo;s changing percent composition with mass spec, we are going to run very fast gradients, we want to compress that time as much as possible, the impact of the particle is actually much less than what we typically see, right? The gradient hides a lot of that and you can get three micron particles, five micron particles to give very high efficiency, if used under the right conditions. So I look at Yes, there is an efficiency and pressure contribution to particles. But when we consider very fast flow rates, and very quick gradient or ballistic gradients, it changes the VAM team or completely. So if we look at Van Demeter, the actual numbers as we drop the particle diameter, so what was in the 1980s was about five micron in the 1990s was three microns. This is when I started. Now we\u0026rsquo;re in an area we have sub two and the superficially porous particles. So we have the contribution of an A term, the b term and then the c term. Notice how flat the c terms are getting. What that indicates to me is, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to have a large impact on linear velocity. So we want to run fast and What I always say is, if you are running a gradient at optimal linear velocity by Van Demeter, you\u0026rsquo;re running too slow. With these new particles and what\u0026rsquo;s available, we can run a lot quicker, what is the limiting factor is the pressure of the system, and how much flow your source can take. That\u0026rsquo;s really the limiting factor today. So run as quickly as possible and use these particles to optimize, not necessarily efficiency because running a gradient, but your pressure profile, and your ability to use a high linear velocity. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a UHPLC column and a superficially porous particle column under the exact same gradient conditions, the peak efficiencies are very similar, the particle diameters are different. But really, what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at is using the instrument conditions, the instrument type, this was a UHPLC. This is a waters acuity, very good system, very low dwell volume, makes everything look really good. But when we start to compare a 2.7 micron SPP particle with a 1.7 FPP, the peak capacity is very similar, different phase. So this activity is different, but we\u0026rsquo;re really seeing the same thing. So what I like to look at is, if we run these at what I like to call optimal efficiency, running at something with mass spec, that\u0026rsquo;s going to give us the best results. If we compare the different particle diameters, a 1.9 micron, these are all Restek products. It\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s not it\u0026rsquo;s just to show how they compare our 1.9 micron DB versus our raptor 2.7. So a fully porous 1.9 with a superficially porous 2.7, because we can run at much higher linear velocity, because the back pressure is lower, we can actually create much higher efficiency, when we look at a five micron version, that things fantastic. Look at the pressure, look at the pressure per plates, you can get a ton of efficiency. So what I always recommend to any customer I\u0026rsquo;m talking to, especially if it\u0026rsquo;s a dirty sample, which I\u0026rsquo;ll show here in a moment, if we do limited sample preparation, we can run with a higher particle column, it\u0026rsquo;ll handle matrix much better. And we can use our our mobile phase, our our flow, our velocity, to really crank up the plates, the only place these things really suffer is if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to run 100 compounds, right, you want to go with a higher particle diameter. But what we\u0026rsquo;re seeing are efficiency differences with pressure that are very substantial, your standard fully pour three and five micron columns, they\u0026rsquo;re not going to produce the plates that you see. So really, in this range is where we\u0026rsquo;re going to see what I like to call the mass spec columns. This is really what we\u0026rsquo;re looking for this is your high peak capacity. Another important contribution to that is the instrument. So my personal favorite, I like these, this is the particle that I like. And this is why because we can fit this on multiple instrumentation, I can take the HPLC that I have in the lab and the UHPLC that I have in the lab and run the same column. And they really run very consistently, what I have found is are we going to see a difference in efficiency between this, this system and that system using that column? Absolutely, the systems are much tighter. But if you look at actually compare efficiencies, we get much lower back pressure at much higher efficiencies. So my personal choice, this is where I start a 2.7 2.6 micron, fused core type product or core shell is a great column for mass spectrometry. Another thing that I found with these particles, so you know how there\u0026rsquo;s this fret in the front, and when matrix comes in, it\u0026rsquo;ll start to contaminate the front of the column. So as it comes in, we start to get this spread. Now, these are two very technical terms, crap and crud. That\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s what you get when you start to inject matrix into these and I work with a lot of customers doing dilute and shoot analysis. Anybody do that? Or know what it is that has a major impact on crap and crud, so your filter will stop the crap. That\u0026rsquo;s the particulates, the pee, but the crud the dissolved stuff is going to stick in here. So what I have found is particle diameter has a large impact on the ability of that column to handle crap and crud. A larger particle has a larger frit size and doesn\u0026rsquo;t clog as quickly. It also has much larger interstitial space, so the impact of crud is less. So if we can run with if we\u0026rsquo;re doing a lot of sample preparation, and it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. But if I\u0026rsquo;m running dilute and shoot, or if I\u0026rsquo;m running some clinical samples, and I\u0026rsquo;m skipping that sample preparation step for speed Higher particle diameters tend to operate at a much greater reproducibility and ruggedness in the long run. So all those factors considered when dealing with these, these types of particles here can give really high efficiencies. So they can work really well. And they can handle a lot of matrix. So, what I like to say for the physical stuff 2.7 micron, right, sub two micron, I like the highly efficient SPP particles, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about the phases here in a second 2.1 millimeter is a good ID, why say it\u0026rsquo;s good, because we can really increase linear velocity to take advantage of that improve, and Demeter and really run and create incredibly fast separations. And I like to work between 50 and 100 millimeters, the major difference here is peak capacity. So, if I\u0026rsquo;m running a panel of five compounds, right, a five micron 2.1 by 50, works great. If I haven\u0026rsquo;t, I really look at number of analytes. If I\u0026rsquo;ve got 200 compounds. And I\u0026rsquo;ll show you an example, we just did a method of 650 pesticides, when when that is what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do, it\u0026rsquo;s 2.7 2.1 by 100, we want that length to increase peak capacity, the length does not matter when we\u0026rsquo;re running a gradient, the analysis time is the gradient time, not the time that it takes to run through that column. So I always keep that in mind. Length is for increased peak capacity. So we covered what I like to call the boring stuff, the physical stuff. Are we still awake? Yeah. Is it any more coffee? Are we good? Are we doing so far? Good. Okay, now let\u0026rsquo;s get into good, we got a half hour for the fun stuff, the chemistry. So we have a mass spec, we know what it\u0026rsquo;s good for. We\u0026rsquo;re going to feed it with good mobile phase, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to feed it with high efficiency. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to try and take care of that matrix as much as possible. So we kind of have a column we know what we\u0026rsquo;re gonna use. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the stationary phases. Because this seems to be probably the area where, at least for me, was the hardest to understand. We can apply mathematics to plates and to gradient illusions. And we can we can do all of that. That\u0026rsquo;s math, when it comes down to this analyte, solubility and phases, this is a lot trickier. So what I\u0026rsquo;d like to provide with you is just a very simple way to view not Restek columns, but columns in general, which ones are made for mass spec? And if I\u0026rsquo;m that mass spec guy who\u0026rsquo;s trying to run, trying to make chromatography, what are the types of columns I need? And more importantly, depending on that type of column, how do I adjust those mobile phase? Because to me, this is really where method development comes in. This is the time this is the spend. So if we can make these choices and understand it very simply, I think it speeds our time up considerably. So what we\u0026rsquo;re really looking at here, is I\u0026rsquo;m going to cover a couple modes. So the first thing we do is what mode are we going to work in? And I assume everybody here does reverse face, right? Does anybody doing hillock or aqueous normal phase type work? Yeah, no, it\u0026rsquo;s a great thing. For mass spec really is, I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about that a little bit. And what really drives these modes are analytes going from insoluble to very water soluble, so we\u0026rsquo;re hillock fits, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to show this here in a second is right in this range right here, where we have something that is so water soluble, that it really doesn\u0026rsquo;t stick to a CA team or other types of phases. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend some time talking about that. But really, for mass spec, we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with this range right here. So if you remember from just general chemistry and chromatography, reverse phase, which by the way, do you guys know why it\u0026rsquo;s called reverse phase? Because it\u0026rsquo;s the reverse of normal phase. The first one, right? Everybody knows reverse phase normals kind of forgotten, but the Aleutian order is reverse. So if I have reverse phase, my hydrophobic compounds retain longer, right more solubility and come out last. A ca teen is an alkyl chain. It\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s grease, right? So nonpolar likes it by hydrophilic compounds come up first, which is the reverse elution order to what we see with normal phase, because we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a nonpolar stationary mobile phase and a polar stationary phase versus non polar stationary phase and polar mobile phase. It is the reverse illusion, where he like comes in or aqueous normal phase and I don\u0026rsquo;t know which one to use. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading a lot on it. And there\u0026rsquo;s certain people that say hillock and aqueous normal phase are not the same thing. They\u0026rsquo;re actually different. I\u0026rsquo;m going to use Hilic, I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure that there is a difference, the result is the same, what we\u0026rsquo;re essentially doing is taking a polar stationary phase, using a polar mobile phase that contains water, creating a layer of water on that surface. So what we get is a reverse phase mobile phase that the mass spec loves. And the illusion order of, of normal phase. So this is our way to retain to get the retention profile that we\u0026rsquo;re looking for using mass spec capable mobile phases. So that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s often termed aqueous normal phase normal phase, Aleutian order aqueous layer. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about both of these things. Because really, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important that the columns we use need to be able to do both of these. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about those because that\u0026rsquo;s really what\u0026rsquo;s amenable to us with mass spectrometry. So we\u0026rsquo;re gonna make some choices from the very beginning when we talk about mode. Honestly, what I have found that makes it the easiest is one way that you can look at it, whatever ionization source I\u0026rsquo;m using, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to take our compounds, we\u0026rsquo;re going to put them through the source, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to look for sensitivity, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna look for ions. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a PcrA ppi, then your analyte composition is very nonpolar. That\u0026rsquo;s a good indicator. In that case, I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to be working with a C at a very nonpolar stationary phase. If I\u0026rsquo;m using positive electrospray, typically, it\u0026rsquo;s going to have a basic functionality and negative is going to have acidic. So it gives you an idea of the overall chemistry. This is going to be important when we start to talk about phases. Another thing I like to take a look at is when looking at these, how do I choose my mode of separation, reverse Bayes is going to work for watersoluble nonpolar compounds, but Hilic is going to work for water soluble polar compounds. So real quick trick that I like to do, take a look at the analyte we can look at log p values. And log p value will give us what we\u0026rsquo;re looking for, right the water octanol partition coefficient, that\u0026rsquo;s really what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about. Sometimes that\u0026rsquo;s not available, the cheat that I like to do count up the carbons to hetero atom ratio, carbons per others that aren\u0026rsquo;t hydrogen. If it\u0026rsquo;s three to one or smaller, it\u0026rsquo;s probably aqueous normal phase, it\u0026rsquo;s probably too water soluble. And then at that point, look at the functionality, acidic functionality, basic functionality. And that\u0026rsquo;ll give you an idea as to where I start my How do I start my choice of phases. So just as a key, look at ionization, and that is a guide to what type of column to use, whatever is working for sensitivity, or for ionization is probably going to work for your chromatography as well. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to use these charts, I think this is probably just an easy way to actually depict what type of columns to use. So if we really break it down to what\u0026rsquo;s happening inside there, when we focus back to that picture, where we had the analyte, binding to the phase, that step of interaction, what\u0026rsquo;s occurring is ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, VanderWaal, interactions, pi pi interactions, or sometimes metal coordination. So this is really everything that\u0026rsquo;s happening in that interaction step in certain phases are going to do some to a better degree. If I have a CA teen phase, it\u0026rsquo;s going to have a lot of VanderWaal, interactions, dispersion, right. So this would be a graph of what a CA teen would look like, it\u0026rsquo;s going to have a little bit of cat ion exchange, a lot of that\u0026rsquo;s metal coordination, right? The silica surface itself, when you bond the phase onto the silica particle, you\u0026rsquo;re not covering the entire thing. So a GC column, a capillary column, you\u0026rsquo;re going to take a polymer, you\u0026rsquo;re going to coat that entire phase, when it comes to a silica particle, you\u0026rsquo;re going to put down these monomers. And the distances that they are apart is going to there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a space in between we Encap it right, we try and fill in the gaps. But there\u0026rsquo;s always a little bit left. So that\u0026rsquo;s metal coordination. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to talk about it in this presentation, but it does exist. What I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus more on is how can we look at dispersion, hydrogen bonding, cat ion exchange, and polarizability. To determine what types of phases do what because that gives us the key to choosing the column. So if we know the chemistry of the analytes, and we know what type of bonds are forming with stationary phases, we link the two together. And that\u0026rsquo;s how we can choose a stationary phase. So it\u0026rsquo;s really looking at that interaction step. And how do we create this? So I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you where these radar plots came from. The hydrophobic subtraction model was used for a lot of things. work. Has anyone ever ever seen this thing before? Yeah. Interesting work. Snyder Dolan car. It was really what I\u0026rsquo;m what I seem to think was it was a way to find calm equivalency, right? USP says you can use this or equivalent or or, or my methods says I can use column x or equivalent, well, how do you know it\u0026rsquo;s equivalent. So this was determined to look at equivalencies and selectivities. But honestly, the equation itself, as I like to say, is a big equation, it\u0026rsquo;s over my head. What it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter, what I found really matters is when you break it down, and you start to measure columns, and you look at the work that was done and how it was done. They took 18 different compounds, and they ran it under two conditions to pH conditions, and they used ethylbenzene as the marker, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at the retention of everything relative to ethylbenzene. And now we can determine flow activities that are the same. So they came up with a selectivity function and F, F sub s, if it\u0026rsquo;s the same, it\u0026rsquo;s a one. If it\u0026rsquo;s 245, then they\u0026rsquo;re not even close to what this that that spread of peaks are. So why I\u0026rsquo;m showing you this is because we can use this for column equivalency purposes, I can take vendor column and check it relative to mine and tell you that those two things are what I would consider to be a match. So not really useful in method development. But what is useful method development is we can take a look at phases, right? And determine which ones are different. Because when we\u0026rsquo;re doing method development, we don\u0026rsquo;t want a lot of the same same column, we want to have a variety. So when you start to look at variety, what we can take a look at is this f sub s function. So on this graph, what we have done is taken everything with the same base silica. And what we\u0026rsquo;re comparing here is the phase itself. And we\u0026rsquo;re looking for very high numbers, because high numbers indicates the PFP propyl is very different from a CA team using the C 18 as a control. And what we can do is look at what phases are actually different. Once we determine what\u0026rsquo;s different, then we can determine different how something\u0026rsquo;s causing this selectivity difference. So what we really came down to is aqueous columns, federal columns, PFP, or fluorinated columns, polar embedded columns, these things create alternate selectivities. That\u0026rsquo;s when we\u0026rsquo;re doing method development. That\u0026rsquo;s crucially important. The cyano gave a pretty good difference between a CA teen but we didn\u0026rsquo;t choose it. Does anybody know why? Because it\u0026rsquo;s a cyano. We don\u0026rsquo;t like cyanosis. Mass Spec in cyano, don\u0026rsquo;t mix in my opinion, don\u0026rsquo;t combine the two. If we\u0026rsquo;re using very acidic mobile phases, and we have a cyano functional group, they don\u0026rsquo;t like one another they\u0026rsquo;re really made for more neutral pH is what I\u0026rsquo;ll show you is the PFP profile is actually very similar in its retention mechanism to the cyano. So these phases are amenable for mass spectrometry, that\u0026rsquo;s really how we looked at it work under common mobile phases, and can be adjusted with changes in mobile phase composition amenable. So here\u0026rsquo;s the perfect column, right? The column that does dispersion, hydrogen bonding, cat ion exchange, and polarizability. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, there is no such thing as this column. As much as we try, we can\u0026rsquo;t seem to make it. But what we can do is this, we can find the phases that produce these types of interactions. And if you notice, we we highlighted these on the list, because this is what actually creates the differences in selectivity. The polar embedded was very different to a CA teen because of hydrogen bonding. The PFP probe or fluorinated phase was very different because of cat ion exchange in federal bass columns were different because of polarizability. So what you get is a retention profile that\u0026rsquo;s vastly different between the two. This is the toolbox. These are the phases that we have that we can now add to that mobile phase we chose for mass spec and create the type of separation or retention we\u0026rsquo;re looking for. So we can use the hydrophobic subtraction model as a way to guide what columns can we use or should we use? So I\u0026rsquo;m going to walk through these I got 10 minutes left, and I think I can do it. So ca team. It\u0026rsquo;s your dispersion column. So when we think about that, there\u0026rsquo;s multiple different types of CA teens, I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to get into the different types of CA teens, but what we\u0026rsquo;re really doing here is dispersion with a little bit of change based on the type that it is. Stable bond or what we call archaic tiene, low pH columns, polar phases that are added aqueous style columns, all of these things are going to add a little bit of selectivity difference. But largely, they\u0026rsquo;re going to be very similar in the overall selectivity. When we look at. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of where you might use one MRM. Windows, we talked about consistent retention. RK teen these little bonds are these little sides that come off here, they protect this bond from hydrolysis. So all phases bleed, sometimes you see it, sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t, when dealing with low pH conditions for mass spec, especially have multiple analytes, the 230 pesticides, those phases can work really well, to keep them to keep the peaks in the window, multiple lots multiple runs, the phase doesn\u0026rsquo;t change, it keeps consistent retention, but really we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with the dispersion reaction, or interaction. So with a CA teen, what do I change, I\u0026rsquo;m going to change organic modifier, right, a Sita nitrile methanol, we know how that works on a CA team, once PROTEK ones a product. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to get different selectivity based on that, we can change pH, we can look at creating different ionization on the molecule with mass spec, not too much of an option, temperature and modifiers like TFA, we can add certain modifiers here to stop cat ion exchange. But really what we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with is this. So C 18. Here\u0026rsquo;s how we adjust it. And this is classic, right? These are what we typically do, what I have found is if you do what you do with a C 18 to a by federal phase, it\u0026rsquo;s not the same result. So we have to look at those each individually. The Federal bass columns, what they do is called polarizability. I think Deshaun was the first one who actually coined that term. And I think it describes it best. The ring itself. It\u0026rsquo;s a neutral molecule, it\u0026rsquo;s symmetrical, right and it\u0026rsquo;s arrangement. But what we have or we have the the the electrons around the ring, when a dipole or an ion comes close to that phase, it\u0026rsquo;ll shift its electron density, it\u0026rsquo;s polarizable, to form that interaction. So it can be much more retentive, for drug like compounds. Anything with a functional group, an electron withdrawing group attached to a ring. These types of phases, because they\u0026rsquo;re polarizable, can work much better in that capacity. So we tend to see them being used for things like steroids, pain panel analysis, anything where we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with drug like compounds, they can give you much higher retention and selectivity. So they tend to work really well in that capacity. You don\u0026rsquo;t change it like you do a CA team. So we can work with the dispersive part. But honestly, the best change to make on a phenol column is choice of organic. With a CA team, you\u0026rsquo;re going to complex based on protocol aprotic solvents, with a phenol it is completely different. And here\u0026rsquo;s the journal article that first mentioned, this effect and how it works. Ultimately, what we have is this. If we have a Sita nitrile in our mobile phase, right, we have C triple bond N, and that phenol phase likes that. So it complexes with that, when we start taking that out and replace it with methanol, it\u0026rsquo;s not the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s methanol, it\u0026rsquo;s the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s not acetic Nitro, you start to get a completely different elution profile, a completely different retention mechanism. So the first thing we do, if we run that column, and we like it, and we want to change it, we focus on choice of organic switches between methanol and acetic. Nitro. And honestly, that is a major component to how these columns work. It\u0026rsquo;s a very quick selectivity. I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna have time to go into the method itself. But what I have learned over time is the first time I ran a method, right, I look back to this and I was so dumb, so dumb. It was three compounds, right? It was three compounds. Looking back was the easiest thing in the world as a first thing I was handed. So what do I run? 5050 methanol water. Sounds good, right? Give it a shot. How many peaks come out? Two, right, three compounds, two peaks come out. Where\u0026rsquo;s that last peak? Let me wait a little bit longer. Right? Okay, let me go to 6040. How many peaks come out to I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they came out or if they didn\u0026rsquo;t come out. So you always start with a scouting gradient, I learned that very quickly run at 5% to 95% with with zero to 95. And you can calculate anything off of that linear curve. You can tell where everything comes out, and you know your pics came out. So if you run that and you like it right on this type of column, and you want to tweak let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to move matrix or you have an isobar you want to try and separate that a little bit more ethanol, that\u0026rsquo;s really all you have to do. And what you\u0026rsquo;ll find is, you\u0026rsquo;re going to get vast differences in selectivity based upon that. So it\u0026rsquo;s a real simple change. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example steroids, going from 100%, methanol to 100%, acetic. Nitro, notice how we took this peak and moved it to there. And that\u0026rsquo;s really what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do. We didn\u0026rsquo;t like it where it was. So we moved it to there. And that\u0026rsquo;s an example of how we can just use this. We didn\u0026rsquo;t get drastically different chromatography. We like what we had initially, but we wanted to move it. And that\u0026rsquo;s an example of how these can work. The flora phenol phases. I like to call these the MF cyano column. And there\u0026rsquo;s two things I really like about them. One, they retain things ca teens cannot. And number two, they\u0026rsquo;re mixed modal. So we can run it in reverse phase mode, or we can run it in hillock mode, and we get to make that choice. So we have a column that can do both. Very good column. Ultimately, what we have here is fluorines. On a ring, the floorings are going to be slightly electron withdrawing. So we got ourselves a charge. So if you think about LC HPLC, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t get something to retain. And we got to the point where we couldn\u0026rsquo;t take organic outturn anymore already in 100% aqueous, we would do what\u0026rsquo;s called ion pairing, we would add it a complex it to neutralize it to stick. So I think really, what happens is that I am pairing agent sticks to the CA teen and it has a charge on it. So we\u0026rsquo;ve applied a charge to the phase, what have we done here, apply to charge to the phase. And it\u0026rsquo;s a cat ion exchanger. So anything basic is going to interact with that very strongly. So this is an example of using ion pairing on the column itself. And that\u0026rsquo;s how I for mass spec. That\u0026rsquo;s how I like to look at it. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example two to one carbon heteroatom ratio, therefore, it is a aqueous normal phase type of a separation being done on a PFP propyl. This is a Carmel coloring impurity. So I like to look at it this way. Mixed Mode columns, reverse phase columns, as we increase organic, we lose retention, right fact is the role of three, the role of three, three fold reduction for 10% increase in organic and that\u0026rsquo;s a roll, you know, throw a two is that 32 fold reduction for 30 degrees and temperature, you know, the role of one is and method development only change one thing at a time. And it\u0026rsquo;s the hardest role to follow. So, as we increase reverse phase organic, we lose retention. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting on these columns, and the next one, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you, as you as you increase organic, you increase retention. So you start to drop, and then you increase because you\u0026rsquo;re switching between the two modes, you can run it in either mode. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t like if you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, just change it to something different. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of catecholamines, very small neurotransmitters. 100% water, right? That\u0026rsquo;s a good UV, not a good mass spec test. But if we go to 80% of Sita Nitro, why my fingers, we go to 80% of Sita Nitro, we\u0026rsquo;ve actually moved the retention out to here, suitable LCMS test. So you see how we can just by adjusting organic, we can change our retention profile on these columns and run in 80% organic and that helps our dig, it does solve a very, very quickly. Example of where they\u0026rsquo;re used hydroxy vitamin EPA MERS, these, this is a big test and clinical can resolve the isobars. Very, very quickly how we adjust this phase, very interesting thing for mass spec folks, acid percentage Aqua acid type and aqueous content, it has the largest impact on selectivity. And this is great, we can change organic to try and mess with this polarizability. But we can also just adjust the percent of acid. If I have point 1% Formic and I don\u0026rsquo;t like where my peaks are, I\u0026rsquo;ll go 2.05%. And I will get completely different selectivity for certain types of compounds. The more ionizable the more it comes up. So I can use percent acid, or changes in acid, maybe acetic acid, formic acid to adjust my selectivity. It\u0026rsquo;s a mass spec amenable and it gives us what we want. We run that scouting gradient. We like this column, it looks pretty good. I can start playing with percent acid and start to move things around. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a silica column in hillock mode, a much greater retention by lowering the percent of formic acid. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s a really simple concept. If we\u0026rsquo;re lowering the acid content, we\u0026rsquo;re lowering the age plus we\u0026rsquo;re inducing cat ion exchange. So it\u0026rsquo;s a very simple concept. That is the greatest impact that we\u0026rsquo;re gonna have. So when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the Florida phases and these polar embedded phases. This is another example, this one is really tweaked for hydrogen bonding, good peak shape for basis, if you want to run one compound, so when I had a real job, and I was doing a potency analysis, or something that was one peak, but 2% RSD is the max that I could have these types of columns worked great for peak shape. So I could get a good peak shape for one compound, where it comes in terms of selectivity is water soluble acids, they can retain the much greater and they can be much more selective for it. So where they\u0026rsquo;re typically used, here\u0026rsquo;s an example. Again, what\u0026rsquo;s nice about these is it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s mixed modal, we can run it in reverse phase mode, or I can run it in hillock mode. And just like the PFP propyl, we get that same type of impact. So we can change aqueous content to get aqueous normal phase or hillock type. But it also works with acid percentage and type. And it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite on these phases, increase to increase retention on the fluorinated decrease to increase retention. And if you think about it, we have anion and cat ion exchange. So by messing with the H plus composition in the mobile phase, we\u0026rsquo;re tweaking the selectivity or the amount of interaction that we can have. So they\u0026rsquo;re the yin and the yang to one another. So they\u0026rsquo;re very simple adjustments, and very simple phases to use. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example highlighted peaks 1%, for MC 2.1. Notice how the neutrals are staying staying put. And we\u0026rsquo;re increasing the selectivity or the retention of just the charged just the charged analytes. And that\u0026rsquo;s an example of we take this, we like it, but we want to move it, we just adjust that. So scouting gradient, get something that works, what works, well look at the ionization source first, and determine what based on that it\u0026rsquo;s going to give you a lot of the composition of the column, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need run that scouting gradient get something you like minimal mobile phase adjustments, with stuff that\u0026rsquo;s mass spec friendly. And you\u0026rsquo;ll find that your separations happen very quickly. So this is probably the most important two slides, this would have saved you an hour of your evening. I could have just given you it this and and saves you a lot of time. But ultimately, when choosing phases, or types for mass spec, we can go reverse phase or we can go aqueous normal phase. Here\u0026rsquo;s how we tell which way we\u0026rsquo;re going to go. If we go this way, here\u0026rsquo;s the types of columns that you can use for mass spec. And here\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;d want to use them. And likewise, we can look on the normal face side or aqueous normal face side, cat ions and ions, conventional would be silica, and then how do we adjust the mobile phases? We do that. So just a very quick kind of guide to take a look at. And again, these are classes of columns, they\u0026rsquo;re not really columns. So polar embedded phenols, right? They\u0026rsquo;re all going to be a little bit different. But this type of paradigm works on pretty much all of those types of columns. There\u0026rsquo;s subtle differences, but I found it works really, really smoothly. So with that, any questions that you guys have was a good the pace good educational, worth your time. Good.

LOD is usually defined as the minimum detectable amount or concentration of a component that can be reliably detected using a given analytical method. In other words, LOD is the lowest amount or concentration of an analyte in a test sample that can be reliably distinguished from zero. In reality, “zero” is obtained from the measurement of a sample not containing the component (blank sample). The usual estimation of LOD in chromatography involves the measurement of signalto-noise ratio (S/N). The chromatographic signal value is determined by the height of the analyte peak and the noise value. The noise value can be derived from either the standard deviation of the noise or from the so called peak-to-peak value. Latter one is determined by injecting a blank sample and using the difference between the highest and lowest points in the baseline noise around the time where the peak of interest would elute. The globally accepted criteria for the detection of an analyte is a S/N ratio of equal to or above 3. Multiple (minimum 3) measurements are performed at the lowest concentration, with all the measurements still showing significant detection of the compound (S/N ≥ 3) for the concentration to be taken as LOD. Limit of detection is the most important value that researchers look for when considering their method’s validity.\nSo how to increase the sensitivity of your analytical method? Logically, it is quite simple: we must either increase the signal or/and decrease baseline noise.\nReduction of baseline noise\nIn many cases, the type of solvent and additives used and their purity in the eluent are strongly responsible for the noise of the baseline. Additives such as TEA or TFA might increase noise due to their relatively high UV absorbance. It is particularly important if the detection is done at low wavelengths of below 220 nm. First, check whether or not the detection can also be performed reliably at longer wavelengths. Doublecheck the eluent selection, for example, methanol exhibits a higher absorption at low wavelengths, which can make the detection of smaller peaks difficult. Uncontrolled temperature drifts during the day for detector and the solvents should also be avoided. Next, even minor impurities from the column after synthesis or because of column bleeding can greatly increase baseline noise. Therefore, it is best to first install a new guard column and, if necessary, also a new separation column and compare the obtained chromatograms. Another factor to be considered is the HPLC system itself. It can be checked for any contamination or air in the system, performance of pumps (pressure fluctuations), lifetime of UV lamp, and cleanliness of the detector cell - all of which can contribute to the baseline noise. Finally, the size of solvent mixing unit. A smaller size offers less contribution to the dead volume, but a higher baseline noise, usually because of less perfect mixing. A larger solvent mixing unit would facilitate a better mixing but would also contribute to larger dead volume. In general, regular maintenance, cleaning cycles, and good understanding of the system’s individual components are prerequisites for a problem-free HPLC analysis.\nIncreasing the signal intensity\nDecrease the column internal diameter (ID). The ID of the HPLC column affects the concentration of the sample in the column. Samples are diluted in proportion to the cross-sectional area of the column and therefore, smaller ID columns yield less dilution. Just a decrease by half of the diameter will result in a ~4 times higher concentration in the detector. Keep in mind that the column capacity is also reduced at the same time and hence the injection volume as well as the flow rate must be adjusted. However, above mentioned increase in sensitivity will be obtained even after adjusting/lowering the injection volume.\nIncreasing column efficiency. Reduction of particle size causes an increase in the sensitivity because of more narrow and higher peaks. Excellent choice is to use superficially porous particle (SPP)/Fused-Core® columns like Ascentis® Express. These will simulate a smaller diameter (more efficient) particle without a larger increase in backpressure. For example, replacing a fully porous 3 µm particle packed column with a superficially porous particles of 2.7 µm, would almost double the column efficiency. Since the efficiency is higher, the peak will be narrower and higher, and by that the sensitivity will increase.\nSystem efficiency. In order to have a high-efficiency separation, it is important to minimize the instrument’s dead volume. This can be achieved by optimizing the entire HPLC system using smaller I.D. and/or shorter connection capillaries, smaller injection unit, and smaller detector cell.\nOptimal flow rate. The resulting peak height/efficiency is also influenced by the choice of the correct flow rate. A too high flow rate (very narrow peaks), at a too low detection frequency may result in losses during detection as the detector simply would not have enough \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo; to reasonably detect the analyte (too few data points). Also, the van Deemter plot should be considered: try to operate at the optimum conditions, selecting an optimal flow rate where efficiency is at its maximum (minimum of theoretical plate height).\nColumn bleeding. The choice of the separation column can also affect the noise levels. Choose chromatographic conditions matching optimum temperature, pH, solvent compatibility, working ranges of the column to minimize potential bleeding effects.\nPeak tailing. Select best column and chromatographic conditions to obtain symmetrical peaks. Optimization of method conditions must be performed to select the most suited buffer, pH, and if necessary, additives. For example, optimal pH value should be +/- 2 pH units of the analytes pKa value, in order to work with the nonionized form. Use of a steep gradient can often yield a sharper peak than isocratic mode alone.\nConclusions:\nIn order to increase your chromatographic method sensitivity, chose one or few options to reduce baseline noise and/or make suggested improvements to increase signal intensity.\nReference:\n Dr. Egidijus Machtejevas, Analytix Reporter | Sigma Aldrich vol 9, 2021 \n"},{"id":276,"href":"/posts/goisforlovers/","title":"(Hu)go Template Primer","section":"Tags","content":"Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine.

More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax #  Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }}  Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }}  Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}  Variables #  Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;  Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }}  Functions #  Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Includes #  When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }}  Logic #  Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration #  Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Conditionals #  If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\n false 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero  Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}}  Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Pipes #  One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}  is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}  It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }}  Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Context (aka. the dot) #  The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n {{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters #  Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters #  In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026quot;Permalinks\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;2013-11-18\u0026quot; aliases: - \u0026quot;/doc/permalinks/\u0026quot; groups: [\u0026quot;extras\u0026quot;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n {{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Using Site (config) Parameters #  In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;text-center\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;author\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;/images/twitter.png\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;48\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Twitter\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026quot;recent\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":277,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Tags","content":"Step 1.
